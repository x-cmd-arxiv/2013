granular matter is essential for a continuum description of natural phenomena
such as debris flow, and the development of various industrial applications
such as the granulation process. The coefficient of restitution (COR), defined
as the ratio between the relative rebound and impact velocities of a binary
impact, is frequently used to characterize the amount of energy dissipation
associated. We measure the COR by tracing a freely falling sphere bouncing on a
wet surface with the liquid film thickness monitored optically. For fixed ratio
between the film thickness and the particle size, the dependence of the COR on
the impact velocity and various properties of the liquid film can be
characterized with the Stokes number, defined as the ratio between the inertia
of the particle and the viscosity of the liquid. Moreover, the COR for
infinitely large impact velocities derived from the scaling can be analyzed by
a model considering the energy dissipation from the inertia of the liquid film.

measured values with simulation predictions. For this reason it is important to
study the differences between the available simulation models. We have done a
study of the first and second moments of the \Xmax distribution using the
\Corsika and \Conex programs. The study was done with high statistics in the
energy range from $10^{17}$ to \energy{20.4}. We focus our analysis in the

negligible in some cases (up to 5 g/cm$^2$ for the worse case) and they should
be considered as a systematic uncertainty of the model predictions for
\meanXmax and \sigmaXmax. We have included a table with the suggested
systematic uncertainties for the model predictions. Finally, we present a
parametrization of the \Xmax distribution as a function of mass and energy

assess the prevalence of disks and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We find no
correlation between either the magnitude or the direction of the AM of the gas

the most massive haloes form massive, compact overdense blobs. These blobs have
an accretion rate ~0.5 Msun/yr (at a distance of 100 pc), and are possible
sites of SMBH formation. Our results suggest that the degree of rotational
support and the fate of the gas in a halo is determined by its large-scale
environment and merger history. In particular, the two haloes forming blobs are
located at knots of the cosmic web, cooled early on, and experienced many
mergers. The gas in these haloes is lumpy and highly turbulent, with Mach N. >~
5. In contrast, the haloes forming rotationally supported cores are relatively
more isolated, located midway along filaments, cooled more recently, and
underwent fewer mergers. Thus, the gas in these haloes is less lumpy and less
turbulent (Mach <~ 4), and could retain most of its AM. The remaining 14 haloes
have intermediate properties. If verified in a larger sample of haloes and with
additional physics, our results will have implications for observations of the

physical mechanisms controlling electron transport through molecules. Electron
motion through a molecular bridge is always somewhat affected by the
environment, and the interactions with the invironment could change the energy
of the traveling electron. Under certain conditions these inelastic effects may
significantly modify electron transport characteristics. In the present work we
describe inelastic and dissipative effects in the electron transport occurring
due to the molecular bridge vibrations and stochastic thermally activated ion
motions. We intentionally use simple models and computational techniques to
keep a reader focused on the physics of inelastic electron transport in
molecular tunnel junctions. We consider electron-vibron interactions and their
manifestations in the inelastic tunneling spectra, polaronic effects and
dissipative electron transport. Also, we briefly discuss long-range electron
transfer reactions in macromolecules and their relation to the electron

The results show that the atmospheres of weak G band stars are highly
contaminated with CN-cycle products. The C underabundance is about a factor of
20 larger than for normal giants and the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio approaches the
CN-cycle equilibrium value. In addition to the striking CN-cycle signature the
strong N overabundance may indicate the presence of partially ON-cycled
material in the atmospheres of the weak G band stars. The exact mechanism
responsible for the transport of the elements to the surface has yet to be
identified but could be induced by rapid rotation of the main sequence
progenitors of the stars. The unusually high Li abundances in some of the stars
are an indicator for Li production by the Cameron-Fowler mechanism. A
quantitative prediction of a weak G band star's Li abundance is complicated by
the strong temperature sensitivity of the mechanism and its participants. In
addition to the unusual abundances of CN-cycle elements and Li we find an
overabundance of Na that is in accordance with the NeNa chain running in
parallel with the CN-cycle. Apart from these peculiarities the element
abundances in a weak G band star's atmosphere are consistent with those of

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/769/1/69",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We reexamine the general synchrotron model for GRBs' prompt emission and
determine the regime in the parameter phase space in which it is viable. We
characterize a typical GRB pulse in terms of its peak energy, peak flux and
duration and use the latest Fermi observations to constrain the high energy
part of the spectrum. We solve for the intrinsic parameters at the emission
region and find the possible parameter phase space for synchrotron emission.
Our approach is general and it does not depend on a specific energy dissipation
mechanism. Reasonable synchrotron solutions are found with energy ratios of
$10^{-4}<\epsilon_B/\epsilon_e<10$, bulk Lorentz factor values of
$300<\Gamma<3000$, typical electrons' Lorentz factor values of $3\times
10^3<\gamma_e<10^5$ and emission radii of the order $10^{15}cm<R<10^{17}$cm.
Most remarkable among those are the rather large values of the emission radius
and the electron's Lorentz factor. We find that soft (with peak energy less
than 100KeV) but luminous (isotropic luminosity of $~1.5 \times 10^{53}$)
pulses are inefficient. This may explain the lack of strong soft bursts. In
cases when most of the energy is carried out by the kinetic energy of the flow,
such as in the internal shocks, the synchrotron solution requires that only a
small fraction of the electrons are accelerated to relativistic velocities by
the shocks. We show that future observations of very high energy photons from
GRBs by CTA, could possibly determine all parameters of the synchrotron model
or rule it out altogether.

load control (DLC) provides an opportunity to reduce peak consumption by
directly controlling the on/off switch of the networked appliances. This paper
proposes a packetized DLC (PDLC) solution that is illustrated by an application
to air conditioning temperature control. Here the term packetized refers to a
fixed time energy usage authorization. The consumers in each room choose their
preferred set point, and then an operator of the local appliance pool will
determine the comfort band around the set point. We use a thermal dynamic model
to investigate the duty cycle of thermostatic appliances. Three theorems are
proposed in this paper. The first two theorems evaluate the performance of the
PDLC in both transient and steady state operation. The first theorem proves
that the average room temperature would converge to the average room set point
with fixed number of packets applied in each discrete interval. The second
theorem proves that the PDLC solution guarantees to control the temperature of
all the rooms within their individual comfort bands. The third theorem proposes
an allocation method to link the results in theorem 1 and assumptions in
theorem 2 such that the overall PDLC solution works. The direct result of the
theorems is that we can reduce the consumption oscillation that occurs when no
control is applied. Simulation is provided to verify theoretical results.

the chemical composition of the interstellar medium in galaxies, the possible
presence of important temperature fluctuations casts some doubt on the derived
abundances. To provide new insights into this question, we have carried out a
detailed study of a giant HII region, H 1013, located in the galaxy M101, for
which many observational data exist and which has been claimed to harbour
temperature fluctuations at a level of t^2 = 0.03-0.06. We have first
complemented the already available optical observational datasets with a
mid-infrared spectrum obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Combined with
optical data, this spectrum provides unprecedented information on the
temperature structure of this giant HII region. A preliminary analysis based on
empirical temperature diagnostics suggests that temperature fluctuations should
be quite weak. We have then performed a detailed modelling using the pyCloudy
package based on the photoionization code Cloudy. We have been able to produce
photoionization models constrained by the observed Hb surface brightness
distribution and by the known properties of the ionizing stellar population
than can account for most of the line ratios within their uncertainties. Since
the observational constraints are both strong and numerous, this argues against
the presence of significant temperature fluctuations in H 1013. The oxygen
abundance of our best model is 12 + log O/H = 8.57, as opposed to the values of
8.73 and 8.93 advocated by Esteban et al. (2009) and Bresolin (2007),
respectively, based on the significant temperature fluctuations they derived.
However, our model is not able to reproduce the intensities of the oxygen
recombination lines . This cannot be attributed to observational uncertainties
and requires an explanation other than temperature fluctuations.

discovered in 3 MUSYC fields. We detected emission lines from four active
galactic nuclei and 13 high-z star-forming galaxies, including Halpha lines
down to a flux of 4.E-17 erg/sec/cm^2. This yielded 7 new redshifts. The most
common emission line detected is [OIII]5007, which is sensitive to Z. We were
able to measure Z for 2 galaxies and to set upper(lower) limits for another
2(2). The Z values are consistent with 0.3<Z/Zsun<1.2. Comparing the Lyalpha
central wavelength with the systemic redshift, we find
Delta_v(Lyalpha-[OIII])=70-270 km/sec. High-redshift star-forming galaxies,
Lyalpha emitting (LAE) galaxies, and Halpha emitters appear to be located in
the low mass, high star-formation rate (SFR) region of the SFR versus stellar
mass diagram, confirming that they are experiencing burst episodes of star
formation, which are building up their stellar mass. Their Zs are consistent
with the relation found for z<2.2 galaxies in the Z versus stellar mass plane.
The measured Delta_v(Lyalpha-[OIII]) values imply that outflows of material,
driven by star formation, could be present in the z=2-3 LAEs of our sample.
Comparing with the literature, we note that galaxies with lower Z than ours are
also characterized by similar Delta_v(Lyalpha-[OIII]) velocity offsets. Strong
[OIII] is detected in many Lyalpha emitters. Therefore, we propose the
Lyalpha/[OIII] flux ratio as a tool for the study of high-z galaxies; while
influenced by Z, ionization, and Lyalpha radiative transfer in the ISM, it may
be possible to calibrate this ratio to primarily trace one of these effects.

energy stored in sunspot magnetic fields is suddenly released. The processes
involved in flaring and the link between sunspot magnetic fields and flares is
still not fully understood, and this thesis aims to gain a better understanding
of these topics. The magnetic field evolution of a number of sunspot regions is
examined using high spatial resolution data from the Hinode spacecraft. The
research presented in this thesis gives insight into both photospheric and
coronal magnetic field evolution of flaring regions. Significant increases in
vertical field strength, current density, and field inclination angle towards
the vertical are observed in the photosphere just hours before a flare occurs,
which is on much shorter timescales than previously studied. First observations
of spatial changes in field inclination across a magnetic neutral line
(generally believed to be a typical source region of flares) are also
discovered. 3D magnetic field extrapolation methods are used to study the
coronal magnetic field, using the photospheric magnetic field data as a
boundary condition. Magnetic energy and free magnetic energy are observed to
increase significantly a few hours before a flare, and decrease afterwards,
which is a similar trend to the photospheric field parameter changes observed.
Evidence of partial Taylor relaxation is also detected after a flare, as
predicted by several previous studies. The results outlined in this thesis show
that this particular field of research is vital in furthering our understanding
of the magnetic nature of sunspots and its link to flare processes.

parameters from their intrinsic values (as seen in the absence of dust) were
obtained by fitting simulated images of disks and bulges produced using
radiative transfer calculations and the model of Popescu et al. (2011). The
fits to the simulations were performed using GALFIT 3.0.2 data analysis
algorithm and the fitted models were the commonly used infinitely thin disks
described by exponential, general Sersic and de Vaucouleurs distributions. We
find the young stellar disks to suffer the most severe variation in the
photometric parameters due to dust effects. In this context we also present
corrections for narrow line (Balmer line) images. Old stellar disks are also
significantly affected by dust, in particular when fits are performed with
exponential functions. The photometric parameters of bulges are to a lesser
extent affected by dust. We also find that the variation of dust corrections
with face-on dust opacity and inclination is similar for bulges with different
intrinsic stellar emissivities (different Sersic index), with differences
manifesting only close to edge-on orientations of the disk. Dust corrections
for bulges are found to be insensitive to the choice of the truncation radius
and ellipticity of the bulge. All corrections are listed in the Appendix and
made available in electronic format.

dispersal of core-forming filaments. In an illustrative model, a filament
contracts radially by self-gravity, increasing the mass of its cores. During
this contraction, FUV photoevaporation and ablation by shocks and winds
disperse filament gas and limit core growth. The stopping times of core growth
are described by a waiting-time distribution. The initial filament column
density profile and the resulting CMF each match recent Herschel observations
in detail. Then low-mass cores have short growth ages and arise from the
innermost filament gas, while massive cores have long growth ages and draw from
more extended filament gas. The model fits the initial density profile and CMF
best for mean core density 2 10^4 cm^-3 and filament dispersal time scale 0.5
Myr. Then the typical core mass, radius, mean column density, and contraction
speed are respectively 0.8 solar masses, 0.06 pc, 6 10^21 cm^-2, and 0.07 km

would unambiguously contain the smallest-mass neutron star observed, and a
system with $\mathcal{M} \ge 2.786 \Msun$ must contain a black hole. However,
additional information would be needed to distinguish between a binary
containing two 1.35 M$_\odot$ neutron stars and an exotic
neutron-star--black-hole binary. We also identify those configurations that
could be unambiguously identified as black-hole binaries, and show how the
observation of an electromagnetic counterpart to a neutron-star--black-hole

superconducting (SC) fluctuations effects has a long history. In these 1D
systems, the effects of commensurate band fillings--strongest at
half-filling--and electronic repulsions typically lead to a finite charge gap
and the favoring of insulating density wave ordering over superconductivity.
Accordingly, recent proposals suggesting a gapless metallic state in the
Holstein-Hubbard (HH) model, possibly superconducting, have generated
considerable interest and controversy, with the most recent work demonstrating
that the putative dominant superconducting state likely does not exist. In this
paper we study a model with non-local electron-phonon interactions, in addition
to electron-electron interactions, this model unambiguously possesses dominant
superconducting fluctuations at half filling in a large region of parameter
space. Using both the numerical multi-scale functional renormalization group
for the full model and an analytic conventional renormalization group for a
bosonized version of the model, we demonstrate the existence of dominant
superconducting (SC) fluctuations. These dominant SC fluctuations arise because
the spin-charge coupling at high energy is weakened by the non-local
electron-phonon interaction and the charge gap is destroyed by the resultant
suppression of the Umklapp process. The existence of the dominant SC pairing
instability in this half-filled 1D system suggests that non-local
boson-mediated interactions may be important in the superconductivity observed
in the organic superconductors.

hole spin or Eddington ratio, is the dominant factor in launching powerful jets
and thus determining the radio loudness of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Most
AGN are radio quiet because the thin accretion disks that feed them are
inefficient in depositing magnetic flux close to the black hole. Flux
accumulation is more likely to occur during a hot accretion (or thick disk)
phase, and we argue that radio-loud quasars and strong emission-line radio
galaxies occur only when a massive, cold accretion event follows an episode of
hot accretion. Such an event might be triggered by the merger of a giant
elliptical galaxy with a disk galaxy.
  This picture supports the idea that flux accumulation can lead to the
formation of a so-called magnetically choked accretion flow (MCAF). The large
observed range in radio loudness reflects not only the magnitude of the flux
pressed against the black hole, but also the decrease in UV flux from the disk,
due to its disruption by the ""magnetosphere"" associated with the accumulated
flux. While the strongest jets result from the secular accumulation of flux,
moderate jet activity can also be triggered by fluctuations in the magnetic
flux deposited by turbulent, hot inner regions of otherwise thin accretion
disks, or by the dissipation of turbulent fields in accretion disk coronae.
These processes could be responsible for jet production in Seyferts and
low-luminosity AGN, as well as jets associated with X-ray binaries.

absorption line equivalent widths that require recent short-lived episodes or
bursts of star formation. The fraction of galaxies that have experienced
episodic rather than continuous star formation is highest for late-type
galaxies with low stellar masses. In these systems, bursts occur both in the
inner and outer regions of the galaxy. The fraction of stars formed in a single
burst episode is typically around 15% of the total stellar mass in the inner
regions of the galaxy and around 5% of the mass in the outer regions. When we
average over the population, we find that such bursts contribute around a half
of the total mass in stars formed in the last 2 Gyr. In massive galaxies,
bursts occur predominantly in the outer disk. Around a third of all massive,
bulge-dominated galaxies have experienced recent star formation episodes that
are fully confined to their outer (R > 0.7R_90) regions. The fraction of stars
formed in a single episode is only 2 - 3 % of the underlying stellar mass, but
such bursts contribute nearly all the stellar mass formed in the last 2 Gyr.
Recent star formation in outer disks is strongly correlated with the global

with emergent gauge structure, fractionalized spinon excitations, and other
unusual properties. While these features clearly distinguish quantum spin
liquids from conventional, mean-field-like states at zero temperature (T),
their status at T>0 is less clear. Strictly speaking, it is known that most
quantum spin liquids lose their identity at non-zero temperature, being in that
case adiabatically transformable into a trivial paramagnet. This is the case
for the U(1) quantum spin liquid states recently proposed to occur in the
quantum spin ice pyrochlores. Here we propose, however, that in practical
terms, the latter quantum spin liquids can be regarded as distinct phases from
the high temperature paramagnet. Through a combination of gauge mean field
theory calculations and physical reasoning, we argue that these systems sustain
both quantum spin liquid and thermal spin liquid phases, dominated by quantum
fluctuations and entropy, respectively. These phases are separated by a first
order ""thermal confinement"" transition, such that for temperatures below the
transition, spinons and emergent photons are coherently propagating
excitations, and above it the dynamics is classical. Even for parameters for
which the ground state is magnetically ordered and not a quantum spin liquid,
this strong first order transition occurs, pre-empting conventional Landau-type
criticality. We argue that this picture explains the anomalously low
temperature phase transition observed in the quantum spin ice material

and Coulomb cooling of cosmic ray electrons during the assembly of a cluster.
We find a substantial population of fossil electrons. When reaccelerated at a
shock (through diffusive shock acceleration), they are competitive with direct
injection at strong shocks and overwhelmingly dominate by many orders of
magnitude at weak shocks, Mach < 3, which are the vast majority at the cluster
periphery. Their relative importance depends on cooling physics and is robust
to the shock acceleration model used. While the abundance of fossils can vary
by a factor of ~10, the typical reaccelerated fossil population has radio
brightness in excellent agreement with observations. Fossil electrons with 1 <

strong (weak) shocks; we show that these are well-resolved by our simulation.
We construct a simple self-similar analytic model which assumes steady recent
injection and cooling. It agrees well with our simulations, allowing rapid
estimates and physical insight into the shape of the distribution function. We
predict that LOFAR should find many more bright steep-spectrum radio relics,
which are inconsistent with direct injection. A failure to take fossil cosmic

of particle acceleration at weak shocks; they arise from well-understood

same regularization methods are unsuccessful for both models and the RNN's
expressivity allows it to overtake the IRLM by 10 and 20 percent perplexity,
respectively. Despite the perplexity gap, IRLMs still outperform RNNs on the
Microsoft Research Sentence Completion (MRSC) task. We develop a slightly
modified IRLM that separates long-context units (LCUs) from short-context units
and show that the LCUs alone achieve a state-of-the-art performance on the MRSC
task of 60.8%. Our analysis indicates that a fruitful direction of research for
neural LMs lies in developing more accessible internal representations, and
suggests an optimization regime of very high momentum terms for effectively
training such models.

indicator. However, it has been suggested that the viability of this age
indicator is, in the best case, limited to stars younger than about 1.5 Gyr. I
aim to define the age range for which chromospheric activity is a robust
astrophysical clock. I collected literature measurements of the S-index in
field stars, which is a measure of the strength of the H and K lines of the Ca
II and a proxy for chromospheric activity, and exploited the homogeneous
database of temperature and age determinations for field stars provided by the
Geneva-Copenhagen survey of the solar neighbourhood. Field data, inclusive data
previously used to calibrate chromospheric ages, confirm the result found using
open cluster data, i.e. there is no decay of chromospheric activity after about
2 Gyr. The only existing indication supporting the viability of chromospheric
ages older than 2 Gyr is the similarity of chromospheric activity levels in the
components of 35 dwarf binaries. However, even in the most optimistic scenario,
uncertainty in age determination for field stars and lack of sufficient data in
open clusters make any attempt of calibrating an age activity relationship for
old stars premature. The hypothesis that chromospheric activity follows the
Skumanich law, i.e. that it is proportional to the inverse square root of the
age, should be relaxed.

fulfill fast control of phase and output power requirements of SC accelerators,
both two-stage injection-locked CW magnetrons are combined with a 3-dB hybrid.
Fast control in output power is achieved by varying the input phase of one of
the magnetrons. For output power up to 250 kW we expect the output/input power
ratio to be about 35 to 40 dB in CW or quasi-CW mode with long pulse duration.
All magnetrons of the transmitter should be based on commercially available

ability to treat infectious diseases. The need for sustainable strategies to
cure bacterial infections has never been greater. So far, all attempts to
restore susceptibility after resistance has arisen have been unsuccessful,
including restrictions on prescribing [1] and antibiotic cycling [2,3]. Part of
the problem may be that those efforts have implemented different classes of
unrelated antibiotics, and relied on removal of resistance by random loss of
resistance genes from bacterial populations (drift). Here, we show that
alternating structurally similar antibiotics can restore susceptibility to
antibiotics after resistance has evolved. We found that the resistance
phenotypes conferred by variant alleles of the resistance gene encoding the TEM
{\beta}-lactamase (blaTEM) varied greatly among 15 different {\beta}-lactam
antibiotics. We captured those differences by characterizing complete adaptive
landscapes for the resistance alleles blaTEM-50 and blaTEM-85, each of which
differs from its ancestor blaTEM-1 by four mutations. We identified pathways
through those landscapes where selection for increased resistance moved in a
repeating cycle among a limited set of alleles as antibiotics were alternated.
Our results showed that susceptibility to antibiotics can be sustainably
renewed by cycling structurally similar antibiotics. We anticipate that these
results may provide a conceptual framework for managing antibiotic resistance.
This approach may also guide sustainable cycling of the drugs used to treat
malaria and HIV.

in the inner early solar system, are intermediate between the protosolar value
and that of most comets. The isotopic composition of cometary water has been
accounted for by several models where the isotopic composition of water vapor
evolved by isotopic exchange with hydrogen gas in the protoplanetary disk.
However, the position and the wide variations of the distribution of D/H ratios
in carbonaceous chondrites have yet to be explained. In this paper, we assume
that the D/H composition of cometary ice was achieved in the disk building
phase and model the further isotopic evolution of water in the inner disk in
the classical T Tauri stage. Reaction kinetics compel isotopic exchange between
water and hydrogen gas to stop at $\sim$500 K, but equilibrated water can be
transported to the snow line (and beyond) via turbulent diffusion and
consequently mix with isotopically comet-like water. Under certain simplifying
assumptions, we calculate analytically this mixing and the resulting
probability distribution function of the D/H ratio of ice accreted in
planetesimals and compare it with observational data. The distribution
essentially depends on two parameters: the radial Schmidt number Sc$_R$, which
ratios the efficiencies of angular momentum transport and turbulent diffusion,
and the range of heliocentric distances of accretion sampled by chondrites. The
minimum D/H ratio of the distribution corresponds to the composition of water
condensed at the snow line, which is primarily set by Sc$_R$. Observations
constrain the latter to low values (0.1-0.3), which suggests that turbulence in
the planet-forming region was hydrodynamical in nature, as would be expected in
a dead zone. Such efficient outward diffusion would also account for the
presence of high-temperature minerals in comets.

heating is the same. These results are explained because, over the electron
gyroradius, $\delta B/B\sim 1$ and $e\delta \phi/T_e\sim 1$, so electron
trajectories are more random and chaotic than adiabatic. Because density
fluctuations are also large, trapping and wave growth in density holes may be
important.

as a means to build better graphical models, but also as a tool to better
understand uncoupled models. The starting point is the observation that some
asymptotic properties of graphical models are easier to prove in the case of
spatial coupling. In such cases, one can then use the so-called interpolation
method to transfer known results for the spatially coupled case to the
uncoupled one.
  Our main use of this framework is for LDPC codes, where we use interpolation
to show that the average entropy of the codeword conditioned on the observation
is asymptotically the same for spatially coupled as for uncoupled ensembles.
  We give three applications of this result for a large class of LDPC
ensembles. The first one is a proof of the so-called Maxwell construction
stating that the MAP threshold is equal to the Area threshold of the BP GEXIT
curve. The second is a proof of the equality between the BP and MAP GEXIT
curves above the MAP threshold. The third application is the intimately related
fact that the replica symmetric formula for the conditional entropy in the
infinite block length limit is exact.

we find the onset of the stripe instability analytically in the axion coupling

study the instability onset by searching for the zero mode numerically on the

two-way relay channels. Unlike most existing works assuming independent noise
at the relays, we consider a more general scenario with correlated relay noise.
We first propose an approach to efficiently solve a class of quadratically
constrained fractional problems via second-order cone programming (SOCP). Then
it is shown that the AF relay optimization problems studied in this paper can
be incorporated into such quadratically constrained fractional problems. As a
consequence, the proposed approach can be used as a unified framework to solve
the optimal AF rate for the one-way relay channel and the optimal AF rate
region for the two-way relay channel under both sum and individual relay power
constraints.
  In particular, for one-way relay channel under individual relay power
constraints, we propose two suboptimal AF schemes in closed-form. It is shown
that they are approximately optimal in certain conditions of interest.
Furthermore, we find an interesting result that, on average, noise correlation
is beneficial no matter the relays know the noise covariance matrix or not for
such scenario. Overall, the obtained results recover and generalize several
existing results for the uncorrelated counterpart. (unsubmitted)

considered under both centralized and decentralized setups. In sequential
estimation, the number of observations used for estimation is determined by the
observed samples, hence is random, as opposed to fixed-sample-size estimation.
Specifically, after receiving a new sample, if a target accuracy level is
reached, we stop and estimate using the samples collected so far; otherwise we
continue to receive another sample. It is known that finding an optimum
sequential estimator, which minimizes the average sample number for a given
target accuracy level, is an intractable problem with a general stopping rule
that depends on the complete observation history. By properly restricting the
search space to stopping rules that depend on a specific subset of the complete
observation history, we derive the optimum sequential estimator in the
centralized case via optimal stopping theory. However, finding the optimum
stopping rule in this case requires numerical computations that {\em
quadratically} scales with the number of parameters to be estimated. For the
decentralized setup with stringent energy constraints, under an alternative
problem formulation that is conditional on the observed regressors, we first
derive a simple optimum scheme whose computational complexity is {\em constant}
with respect to the number of parameters. Then, following this simple optimum
scheme we propose a decentralized sequential estimator whose computational
complexity and energy consumption scales {\em linearly} with the number of
parameters. Specifically, in the proposed decentralized scheme a
close-to-optimum average stopping time performance is achieved by infrequently
transmitting a single pulse with very short duration.

particular statistics, such as the one-level density, which evaluates a test
function with compactly supported Fourier transform at normalized zeros near
the central point. Iwaniec, Luo, and Sarnak studied the one-level densities of
cuspidal newforms of weight $k$ and level $N$. They showed in the limit as $kN

orthogonal type for test functions with Fourier transform supported in

indistinguishable for support up to $(-1,1)$ but are distinguishable for any

however, recently Iyer, Lazarev, Miller and Zhang proved that a positive

${0,...,N}$ to be in $A$ with probability 1/2. We investigate what happens when
instead each element is chosen with probability $p(N)$, with $\lim_{N\to\infty}

the decoherence functional. The new ontology turns out to be that of a
coarse-grained history. We start with a quantum measure defined on the space of
histories, and the existence of zero covers rules out single-history as
potential reality (the Kochen Specker theorem casted in histories form is a
special case of a zero cover). We see that allowing coarse-grained histories as
potential realities avoids the previous paradoxes, maintains deductive
non-contextual logic (alas non-Boolean) and gives rise to a unique classical
domain. Moreover, we can recover the probabilistic predictions of quantum
theory with the use of the Cournot's principle. This formulation, being both a
realist formulation and based on histories, is well suited conceptually for the
purposes of quantum gravity and cosmology.

two primary components - the dark matter and the dark energy. The dark matter
is treated as an ideal fluid. The dark energy is described by a single scalar
field with a potential which is hold unspecified as long as the theory permits.
The Lagrangian of the dark matter and that of the scalar field are formulated
in terms of the field variables. We use variational calculus to derive the
gauge-invariant field equations of the post-Newtonian celestial mechanics of an
isolated astronomical system in an expanding universe. These equations
generalize the field equations of the post-Newtonian theory in
asymptotically-flat spacetime by taking into account the cosmological effects
explicitly. We introduce a new cosmological gauge which generalizes the
harmonic gauge of the post-Newtonian theory in asymptotically-flat spacetime.
This gauge significantly simplifies the gravitational field equations and
allows finding out the approximations where the field equations can be fully
decoupled and solved analytically. The residual gauge freedom is explored. The
results of the present paper can be useful in the solar system for calculating
more precise ephemerides of the solar system bodies on extremely long time
intervals, in galactic astronomy to study the dynamics of clusters of galaxies,

flux in this line illuminating an exoplanet's atmosphere cannot be measured
directly as neutral hydrogen in the interstellar medium (ISM) attenuates most
of the flux reaching the Earth. Reconstruction of the intrinsic Lyman-alpha
line has been accomplished for a limited number of nearby stars, but is not
feasible for distant or faint host stars. We identify correlations connecting
the intrinsic Lyman-alpha flux with the flux in other emission lines formed in
the stellar chromosphere, and find that these correlations depend only
gradually on the flux in the other lines. These correlations, which are based
on HST spectra, reconstructed Lyman-alpha line fluxes, and irradiance spectra

atmospheres when intrinsic Lyman-alpha fluxes are not available. We find a
tight correlation of the intrinsic Lyman-alpha flux with stellar X-ray flux for

one-dimensional random walks. More precisely, if $(S_n)_{n \geq 0}$ is a random
walk starting from 0 and $r\geq 0$, we obtain the precise asymptotic behavior
as $n\to\infty$ of $\mathbb P[\tau^{>r}=n, S_n\in K]$ and $\mathbb
P[\tau^{>r}>n, S_n\in K]$, where $\tau^{>r}$ is the first time that the random
walk reaches the set $]r,\infty[$, and $K$ is a compact set. Our assumptions on
the jumps of the random walks are optimal. Our results give an answer to a
question of Lalley stated in [9], and are applied to obtain the asymptotic
behavior of the return probabilities for random walks on $\mathbb R^+$ with
non-elastic reflection at 0.

non-trivial conditions on the Shannon entropies of the associated probability
distributions, expressed by linear entropic Bell inequalities. In principle,
these entropic inequalities provide necessary but not sufficient criteria for
the existence of a local hidden variable model reproducing the correlations,
as, for example, the paradigmatic nonlocal PR-box is entropically not different
from a classically correlated box. In this paper we show that for the n-cycle
scenario, entropic inequalities completely characterize the set of local
correlations. In particular, every nonsignalling box which violates the CHSH
inequality -- including the PR-box -- can be locally modified so that it also
violates the entropic version of CHSH inequality. As we show, any nonlocal
probabilistic model when appropriately mixed with a local model, violates an
entropic inequality, thus evidencing a very peculiar kind of nonlocality. As
the n-cycle captures equally well both the notion of local realism introduced
by Bell and that of noncontextuality presented by the Kochen-Specker theorem,
the results are also valid for noncontextuality scenarios.

It is found that the thickness is small but increases steadily if the
neutron-star envelope is contaminated by sufficient light elements. For such a
light element envelope, the gamma-ray luminosity of the accelerator is kept
approximately constant as a function of age in the initial ten thousand years,
forming the lower bound of the observed distribution of the gamma-ray
luminosity of rotation-powered pulsars. If the envelope consists of only heavy
elements, on the other hand, the thickness is greater but increases less
rapidly than what a light element envelope has. For such a heavy element
envelope, the gamma-ray luminosity decreases relatively rapidly, forming the
upper bound of the observed distribution. The gamma-ray luminosity of a general
pulsar resides between these two extreme cases, reflecting the envelope
composition and the magnetic inclination angle with respect to the rotation
axis. The cutoff energy of the primary curvature emission is regulated below
several GeV even for young pulsars, because the gap thickness, and hence the
acceleration electric field is suppressed by the polarization of the produced
pairs.

problem is used. Both univariate and multivariate switching models are

type 2 errors of the proposed method converge to zero exponentially as the
sample size tends to infinity. In theorem 3 we prove that the proposed method
is asymptotically optimal by the rate of this convergence in the sense that the
lower bound in the a priori informational inequality is attained for our
method. Several generalizations to the case of multiple univariate mixtures of
probabilistic distributions are considered. For the multivariate case, we first
study the general problem of classification of the whole array of data into
several sub-arrays of observations from different regimes of a multivariate
stochastic model with switching states. Then we consider regression models with

projection. Permeability fields with high contrast are considered to
investigate the capability of these techniques to capture the main flow
features and forecast the flow evolution within a certain accuracy. A DMD-based
approach shows a better predictive capability due to its ability to accurately
extract the information relevant to long-time dynamics, in particular, the
slowly-decaying eigenmodes corresponding to largest eigenvalues. Our study
enables a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the
applicability of these techniques for flows in high-contrast porous media.
Furthermore, we discuss the robustness of DMD- and POD-based reduced-order
models with respect to variations in initial conditions, permeability fields,
and forcing terms.

understand how the behaviour of players is affected by the topology of the
network interconnecting them. Many models which involve networks of interacting
players have been proposed and best response games are amongst the simplest. In
best response games each vertex simultaneously updates to employ the best
response to their current surroundings. We concentrate upon trying to
understand the dynamics of best response games on regular graphs with many
strategies. When more than two strategies are present highly complex dynamics
can ensue. We focus upon trying to understand exactly how best response games
on regular graphs sample from the space of possible cellular automata. To
understand this issue we investigate convex divisions in high dimensional space
and we prove that almost every division of $k-1$ dimensional space into $k$
convex regions includes a single point where all regions meet. We then find
connections between the convex geometry of best response games and the theory
of alternating circuits on graphs. Exploiting these unexpected connections
allows us to gain an interesting answer to our question of when cellular
automata are best response games.

consider a variety of high-contrast coefficients and present the corresponding

of flows in high-contrast porous media. In the current paper, we discuss how
these global model reduction approaches can be combined with local techniques
to speed-up the simulations. The speed-up is due to inexpensive, while

the most chaotic state) as a sign of increasing (decreasing) degree of order in
all the investigated periodic windows, namely, period-2, 3, and 5, thereby
proving the robustness of this complexity measure. This observed change in the
renormalized entropy is adequate, since the bifurcations are exhibited before
the accumulation point, after which the band-merging, in opposition to the
bifurcations, is exhibited. In addition to the precise detection of the
accumulation points in all these windows, it is shown that the renormalized
entropy can detect the self-similar windows in the chaotic regime by exhibiting
abrupt changes in its values. Regarding the sine-circle map, we observe that
the renormalized entropy detects also the quasi-periodic regimes by showing
oscillatory behavior particularly in these regimes. Moreover, the oscillatory
regime of the renormalized entropy corresponds to a larger interval of the
nonlinearity parameter of the sine-circle map as the value of the frequency
ratio parameter reaches the critical value, at which the winding ratio attains

cooling in a self-consistent manner. We show that MgSiO3 grains grow
sufficiently at gas densities nH = 10^{10}, 10^{12}, and 10^{14} /cc for
metallicities Z = 10^{-4}, 10^{-5}, and 10^{-6} Zsun, respectively, where the
cooling of the collapsing gas cloud is enhanced. The condition for efficient
dust cooling is insensitive to the initial condensation factor of pre-existing
grains within the realistic range of 0.001--0.1, but sensitive to metallicity.
The critical metallicity is Zcrit ~ 10^{-5.5} Zsun for the initial grain radius
r_{MgSiO3,0} <~ 0.01 um and Zcrit ~ 10^{-4.5} Zsun for r_{MgSiO3,0} >~ 0.1 um.
The formation of a recently discovered low-mass star with extremely low
metallicity (<= 4.5x10^{-5} Zsun) could have been triggered by grain growth.

we discovered three objects characterized by an extremely low level of gas
excitation and a large deficit of line emission with respect to RGs of similar
radio luminosity. We interpreted these objects as relic active galactic nuclei
(AGN), i.e., sources observed after a large drop in their nuclear activity. We
here present new spectroscopic observations for these three galaxies and for a
group of ""candidate"" relics. None of the candidates can be convincingly
confirmed. From the new data for the three relics, we estimate the density of
the line-emitting gas. This enables us to explore the temporal evolution of the
line ratios after the AGN ""death"". The characteristic timescale is the
light-crossing time of the emission line region, a few thousand years, too
short to correspond to a substantial population of relic RGs. Additional
mechanisms of gas ionization, such as ""relic shocks"" from their past high power
phase or stellar sources, should also be considered to account for the
spectroscopic properties of the relic RGs. Relic RGs appear to be a mixed bag
of sources in different phases of evolution, including AGN recently (~10,000
years ago) quenched, galaxies that have been inactive for at least one million
years, and objects caught during the transition from a powerful RG to a low
power FRI source.

strong preferential concentration which we quantify by means of Voronoi

photon spectrum towards the galactic center have been reported. If the distinct
line features arise from dark matter (DM) annihilation into $\gamma X
(X=\gamma, Z^{0} or h^{0})$, the corresponding annihilation cross-section is
unnaturally large for typical loop-induced radiative processes. On the other
hand, it is still too small to be responsible for the observed DM relic
density. We show that the mechanism of Sommerfeld enhancement with scalar
force-carrier can provide a simple solution to these puzzles. The possibly
large Sommerfeld enhancement of the cross-section for s-wave DM annihilation
can significantly reduce the required effective couplings between DM and
charged particles in typical loop diagrams. The DM particles necessarily
annihilate into scalar force-carriers through tree-level p-wave process, which
can dominate the total DM annihilation cross-section at freeze out, resulting
in the correct thermal relic density, but has subdominant contributions to the
DM annihilation today due to velocity suppression. We perform detailed analysis
on the effects of p-wave Sommerfeld enhancement on freeze out. The results show

(BBO), with their excellent projected, one sigma angular resolution, will
measure the luminosity distance to a large number of gravity wave (GW) sources
to high precision, and the redshift of the single galaxies in the narrow solid
angles towards the sources will provide the redshifts of the gravity wave
sources. One sigma BBO beams contain the actual source only in 68 per cent
cases; the beams that do not contain the source may contain a spurious single
galaxy, leading to misidentification. To increase the probability of the source
falling within the beam, larger beams have to be considered, decreasing the
chances of finding single galaxies in the beams. Saini, Sethi and Sahni (2010)
argued, largely analytically, that identifying even a small number of GW source
galaxies furnishes a rough distance-redshift relation, which could be used to
further resolve sources that have multiple objects in the angular beam. In this
work we further develop this idea by introducing a self-calibrating iterative
scheme which works in conjunction with Monte-Carlo simulations to determine the
luminosity distance to GW sources with progressively greater accuracy. This
iterative scheme allows one to determine the equation of state of dark energy
to within an accuracy of a few percent for a gravity wave experiment possessing
a beam width an order of magnitude larger than BBO (and therefore having a far
poorer angular resolution). This is achieved with no prior information about
the nature of dark energy from other data sets such as SN Ia, BAO, CMB etc.

atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune are analyzed in order to derive a D/H ratio
with improved precision for both planets. The derivation of the D/H ratio
includes also previous measurements of the R(2) line by the Short Wavelength
Spectrometer on board the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). The available
spectroscopic line information of the three rotational transitions is discussed
and applied in the radiative transfer calculations. The best simultaneous fit
of all three lines requires only a minor departure from the Spitzer temperature
profile of Uranus and a departure limited to 2K from the Voyager temperature
profile of Neptune (both around the tropopause). The resulting and remarkably
similar D/H ratios for Uranus and Neptune are found to be
(4.4$\pm$0.4)$\times10^{-5}$ and (4.1$\pm$0.4)$\times10^{-5}$ respectively.
Although the deuterium enrichment in both atmospheres compared to the
protosolar value is confirmed, it is found to be lower compared to previous
analysis. Using the interior models of Podolak et al. (1995), Helled et al.
(2011) and Nettelmann et al. (2013), and assuming that complete mixing of the
atmosphere and interior occured during the planets history, we derive a D/H in
protoplanetary ices between (5.75--7.0)$\times10^{-5}$ for Uranus and between
(5.1--7.7)$\times10^{-5}$ for Neptune. Conversely, adopting a cometary D/H for
the protoplanetary ices between (15-30)$\times10^{-5}$, we constrain the
interior models of both planets to have an ice mass fraction of 14-32%, i.e.
that the two planets are rock-dominated.

positive correlation between both citation indicators and the AGREE score of

opposite to an external magnetic field. Magnetic nanoclusters are known to be
characterized by large magnetic anisotropy and strong dipole interactions. It
is also impossible to produce a number of nanoclusters with identical
properties. As a result, any realistic system of nanoclusters is composed of
the clusters with randomly varying anisotropies, effective spins, and dipole
interactions. Despite this randomness, it is possible to find conditions when
the cluster spins move coherently and display fast magnetization reversal due
to the feedback action of resonator. By analyzing the influence of different
cluster parameters, we find their optimal values providing fast magnetization
reversal.

properties except in the case of tidal, or proportionally large collisional
interactions with other objects, the influence of the latter being different
for each sub-population. We also present phase curves and colors for some

verify that this indeed leads to a fibre of Kodaira type IV*. Based on this
observation, we argue i) that the singular fibre types appearing in the
fourfolds studied by Esole-Yau are not puzzling at all, (so that this class of
fourfolds does not have to be excluded from the candidate of input data of some
yet-unknown formulation of F-theory) and ii) that such fourfold geometries also
contain more information than just the eigenvalues of the Higgs field vev
configuration in the field theory local models.

gas turbulence, which drives transport in protoplanetary disks. The commonly
used viscous prescription for the Maxwell-Reynolds stress tensor gives rise to
a meridional circulation where flow is outward near the midplane and inward
away from it. This meridional circulation has been proposed as an explanation
for the presence of high-temperature minerals (believed to be of inner solar
system provenance) in comets. However, it has not been observed in simulations
of magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence so far. In this study, we evaluate
the extent to which the net transport of solids can be diagnostic of the
existence of meridional circulation. To that end, we propose and motivate a
prescription for MHD turbulence which has the same free parameters as the
viscous one. We compare the effects of both prescriptions on the radial
transport of small solid particles and find that their net, vertically
integrated radial flux is actually quite insensitive to the flow structure for
a given vertical average of the turbulence parameter $\alpha$, which we
explain. Given current uncertainties on disk turbulence, one-dimensional models
are thus most appropriate to investigate radial transport of solids. A
corollary is that the presence of high-temperature material in comets cannot be
considered an unequivocal diagnostic of meridional circulation. In fact, we
argue that outward transport in viscous disk models is more properly attributed
to turbulent diffusion rather than to the mean flows of the gas.

steadily intensify until they reach fusion temperatures. Without this process,
the universe would be dark and dead. Yet the spontaneous concentration of heat
is exactly what the Second Law of Thermodynamics is in most cases supposed to
forbid. The formation of protostars has been much discussed, for its
consistency with the Second Law depends on a thermodynamical property that is
common in systems whose strongest force is their own gravity, but otherwise
very rare: negative specific heat. Negative specific heat turns the world
upside down, thermodynamically; it implies that entropy increases when energy
flows from lower to higher energy subsystems, opposite to the usual direction.
Recent experiments have reported negative specific heat in melting atomic
clusters and fragmenting nuclei, but these arguably represent transient
phenomena outside the proper scope of thermodynamics. Here we show that the
counter-intuitive thermodynamics of spontaneous energy concentration can be
studied experimentally with trapped quantum gases, by using optical lattice
potentials to realize weakly coupled arrays of simple dynamical subsystems that
share the peculiar property of self-gravitating protostars, of having negative
micro-canonical specific heat. Numerical solution of real-time evolution
equations confirms the spontaneous concentration of energy in such arrays, with
initially dispersed energy condensing quickly into dense 'droplets'. We
therefore propose laboratory studies of negative specific heat as an elusive
but fundamentally important aspect of thermodynamics, which may shed fresh
light on the general problem of how thermodynamics emerges from mechanics.

redundant variables in the strategies. We show that current methods (e.g. the

  Actually, this paper takes a more general outset: When formulating a decision
scenario as an influence diagram, a linear temporal ordering of the decisions
variables is required. This constraint ensures that the decision scenario is
welldefined. However, the structure of a decision scenario often yields certain
decisions conditionally independent, and it is therefore unnecessary to impose
a linear temporal ordering on the decisions. In this paper we deal with partial

learning set where classes are only partially known; 2) an information

data from sensors competent on partially overlapping frames; 4) the
determination of the number of sources in a multi-sensor environment by
studying the inter-sensors contradiction. The purpose of the paper is to report
on such applications where the use of belief functions provides a convenient
tool to handle ?messy' data problems.

obligations based on the update semantics of Veltman. In DUS the definition of
logical validity of obligations is not based on static truth values but on
dynamic action transitions. In this paper prescriptive defeasible obligations
are formalized in update semantics and the diagnostic problem of defeasible
deontic logic is discussed. Assume a defeasible obligation `normally A ought to
be (done)' together withthe fact `A is not (done).' Is this an exception of the
normality claim, or is it a violation of the obligation? In this paper we
formalize the heuristic principle that it is a violation, unless there is a
more specific overriding obligation. The underlying motivation from legal
reasoning is that criminals should have as little opportunities as possible to
excuse themselves by claiming that their behavior was exceptional rather than
criminal.

probability distribution of the modeled domain. The locality of both structure
and probabilistic information are the great benefits of Bayesian networks and
require the modeler to only specify local information. On the other hand this
locality of information might prevent the modeler - and even more any other
person - from obtaining a general overview of the important relationships
within the domain. The goal of the work presented in this paper is to provide
an ""alternative"" view on the knowledge encoded in a Bayesian network which
might sometimes be very helpful for providing insights into the underlying
domain. The basic idea is to calculate a mixture approximation to the
probability distribution represented by the Bayesian network. The mixture
component densities can be thought of as representing typical scenarios implied
by the Bayesian model, providing intuition about the basic relationships. As an
additional benefit, performing inference in the approximate model is very
simple and intuitive and can provide additional insights. The computational
complexity for the calculation of the mixture approximations criticaly depends
on the measure which defines the distance between the probability distribution
represented by the Bayesian network and the approximate distribution. Both the
KL-divergence and the backward KL-divergence lead to inefficient algorithms.
Incidentally, the latter is used in recent work on mixtures of mean field
solutions to which the work presented here is closely related. We show,
however, that using a mean squared error cost function leads to update
equations which can be solved using the junction tree algorithm. We conclude
that the mean squared error cost function can be used for Bayesian networks in
which inference based on the junction tree is tractable. For large networks,
however, one may have to rely on mean field approximations.

investigating rational belief changes. Unfortunately, researchers working in
this paradigm have restricted much of their attention to rather simple
representations of belief states, namely logically closed sets of propositional
sentences. In our opinion, this has resulted in a too abstract categorisation
of belief change operations: expansion, revision, or contraction. Occasionally,
in the AGM paradigm, also probabilistic belief changes have been considered,
and it is widely accepted that the probabilistic version of expansion is
conditioning. However, we argue that it may be more correct to view
conditioning and expansion as two essentially different kinds of belief change,
and that what we call constraining is a better candidate for being considered
probabilistic expansion.

too restrictive to capture independencies that only hold in certain contexts.
This kind of contextual independency, called context-strong independence (CSI),
can be used to facilitate the acquisition, representation, and inference of
probabilistic knowledge. In this paper, we suggest the use of contextual weak
independence (CWI) in Bayesian networks. It should be emphasized that the
notion of CWI is a more general form of contextual independence than CSI.
Furthermore, if the contextual strong independence holds for all contexts, then
the notion of CSI becomes strong CI. On the other hand, if the weak contextual
independence holds for all contexts, then the notion of CWI becomes weak
independence (WI) nwhich is a more general noncontextual independency than
strong CI. More importantly, complete axiomatizations are studied for both the
class of WI and the class of CI and WI together. Finally, the interesting
property of WI being a necessary and sufficient condition for ensuring
consistency in granular probabilistic networks is shown.

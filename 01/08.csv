distributions and ratios from the inner ~680pc radius of the Seyfert 1 galaxy
Mrk79, using two-dimensional (2D) near-IR J- and Kl-band spectra obtained with
the Gemini instrument NIFS at a spatial resolution of ~100pc and velocity
resolution of ~40km/s. The molecular hydrogen flux distribution presents two
spiral arms extending by ~700pc, one to the north and another to the south of
the nucleus, with an excitation indicating heating by X-rays from the central
source. The low velocity dispersion (sigma~50km/s) and rotation pattern
supports a location of the H2 gas in the disk of the galaxy. Blueshifts
observed along the spiral arm in the far side of the galaxy and redshifts in
the spiral arm in the near side, suggest that the spiral arms are feeding
channels of H2 to the inner 200pc. From channel maps along the H2 l2.1218um
emission-line profile we estimate a mass inflow rate of ~4E-3 M_Sun/year, which
is one order of magnitude smaller than the mass accretion rate necessary to
power the AGN of Mrk79. The emission from the ionized gas (traced by Pabeta and
[FeII]l1.2570um emission lines) is correlated with the radio jet and with the
narrow-band [OIII] flux distribution. Its kinematics shows both rotation and
outflows to the north and south of the nucleus. The ionized gas mass outflow
rate through a cross section with radius ~320pc located at a distance of ~455pc
from the nucleus is 3.5 MSun/year, which is much larger than the AGN mass
accretion rate, indicating that most of the outflowing gas originates in the
interstellar medium surrounding the galaxy nucleus, which is pushed away by a
nuclear jet.

range 159 < MH < 176 GeV is excluded while the expected exclusion sensitivity
is 156 < MH < 172 GeV. For a mass hypothesis of MH = 125 GeV, we exclude Higgs
boson production cross sections 4.1 times larger than the standard model

mass. Within a theoretical framework with a fourth generation of fermions, the
mass range 125 < MH < 218 GeV is excluded. The search results are also
interpreted in the context of fermiophobic Higgs boson couplings, which yields
an exclusion of fermiophobic Higgs boson production cross sections 3.1 times

carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. These standard candles are only behind supernovae
and $\gamma$-ray bursts as the third brightest objects in the sky, and the most
probable progenitors of type Ia supernovae.
  After a nova outburst the system enters into the constant bolometric
luminosity phase and the nova maintains a stable hydrogen burning in the
surface layers of the white dwarf. As the expanding shell around the nova
attenuates, progressively deeper and hotter layers become visible. At the end
of the constant bolometric luminosity phase, the hottest layers are exposed and
novae radiate X-rays.
  This work uses the static, plane-parallel model atmosphere code TLUSTY to
calculate atmospheric structure and SYNSPEC to calculate synthetic X-ray
spectra. It was necessary to incorporate atomic data for the highest ionization
stages of elements ranging from hydrogen to iron in both programs. Atomic data
on energy levels, bound-free, bound-bound transitions and natural broadening
were taken from NIST and TOPbase.
  Extensive tests revealed the importance of line opacities on atmospheric
parameters and on the final spectra. A correlation can be defined between
effective temperature and surface gravity. The spectral appearance is not very
sensitive to the joint changes of both. Due to this effect both parameters
might be over-estimated with static models. These tests also showed that N VI
and N VII lines are good indicators of the effective temperature.
  Model fitting of V4743 Sgr and V2491 Cyg confirmed the anticipated impact of
modeling geometry and stellar wind. The ionization balance and line profiles
indicate that both novae are close to or over the Eddington limit. These
results are consistent with previous studies; further and unambiguous details
require a comprehensive update of TLUSTY, what is under way.

modules. Auslander was very passionate about these ivestigations (they also
form part of the final chapter of the Auslander-Reiten-Smaloe book and could
and should be seen as its culmination), but the feedback until now seems to be
somewhat meager. The theory presented by Auslander has to be considered as an
exciting frame for working with the category of A-modules, incorporating all
what is known about irreducible maps (the usual Auslander-Reiten theory), but
the frame is much wider and allows for example to take into account families of
modules - an important feature of module categories. What Auslander has
achieved is a clear description of the poset structure of the category of
A-modules as well as a blueprint for interrelating individual modules and
families of modules. Auslander has subsumed his considerations under the
heading of ""morphisms being determined by modules"". Unfortunately, the wording
in itself seems to be somewhat misleading, and the basic definition may look
quite technical and unattractive, at least at first sight. This could be the
reason that for over 30 years, Auslander's powerful results did not gain the
attention they deserve. The aim of this survey is to outline the general
setting for Auslander's ideas and to show the wealth of these ideas by
exhibiting many examples.

the overall variation of the comparator sequence. In many practical scenarios,
however, the environment is nonstationary and comparator sequences with small

waves are nonlinearly stable. This represents the first demonstration of
nonlinear stability for detonation-wave solutions of the Majda model without a
smallness assumption. Notably, our results indicate that, for the simplified
Majda model, there does not occur, either in a normal parameter range or in the
limit of high activation energy, Hopf bifurcation to ""galloping"" or ""pulsating""
solutions as is observed in the full reactive Navier-Stokes equations. This
answers in the negative a question posed by Majda as to whether the scalar
detonation model captures this aspect of detonation behavior.

that there is little information about this topic. This necessitates the
importance of studying them in detail. They have been observed as very bright
clouds of gases of past geological lunar activity. According its duration,
there have been registered in different colors (yellow, orange, red). Its size
can vary from a few to hundreds of kilometers. The TLP Usually occur in certain
locations as in some craters (Aristarchus, Plato, Kepler, etc.) and at the
edges of lunar maria (Sea of Fecundity, Alps hills area, etc.). The exposure
time of a TLP can vary from a few seconds to a little more than one hour.
  In this paper, a literature review of the TLP is made to build a theory from
the existing reports and scientific hypotheses, trying to unify and synthesize
data and concepts that are scattered by different lunar research lines. The TLP
need to be explained from celestial mechanics and planetary astrophysics to
explain the possible causes from phenomena such as outgassing moon, moonquakes

most consistent. It is build also a the theory of how to observe, describe,

spin-velocity alignment, which has been observed for a sample of 58 pulsars, on
pulsar age. At first, our study considers only pulsar characteristic ages,
resulting in no change in the degree of correlation as a function of age, up to
at least 100 Myr. Subsequently, we consider a more reliable estimate of pulsar
age, the kinematic age, assuming that pulsars are born near the Galactic plane.
We derive kinematic ages for 52 pulsars, based on the measured pulsar proper
motions and positions, by modelling the trajectory of the pulsars in a Galactic
potential. The sample of 52 pulsar kinematic ages constitutes the largest
number of independently estimated pulsar ages to date. Using only the 33 most
reliable kinematic ages from our simulations, we revisit the evolution of spin-
velocity alignment, this time as a function of kinematic age. We find that the
strong correlation seen in young pulsars is completely smeared out for pulsars
with kinematic ages above 10 Myr, a length of time beyond which we expect the
gravitational pull of the Galaxy to have a significant effect on the directions
of pulsar velocities. In the discussion, we investigate the impact of large
distance uncertainties on the reliability of the calculated kinematic ages.
Furthermore, we present a detailed investigation of the implications of our
revised pulsar ages for the braking-index and birth-period distributions.

X-ray binaries (HMXBs). In this paper (Paper II of the series) and the

(LMXBs), whose evolutionary scenario is very different from that of HMXBs. In
this paper, we consider the evolution of primordial binaries upto the stage
where the neutron star just formed in the supernova explosion of the primary is
in a binary with its low-mass unevolved companion, and this binary has
circularized tidally, producing what we call a pre-low-mass X-ray binary
(pre-LMXB). We study the constraints on the formation of such pre-LMXBs in
detail (since these are low probability events), and calculate their collective
properties and formation rate. To this end, we first consider the changes in
the binary parameters in the various steps involved, viz., the common-envelope
(CE) phase, the supernova, and the tidal evolution. This naturally leads to a
clarification of the constraints. We then describe our calculation of the
evolution of the distributions of primordial binary parameters into those of
the pre-LMXB parameters, following the standard evolutionary scenario for
individual binaries. We display the latter as both bivariate and monovariate
distributions, discuss their essential properties, and indicate the influence
of some essential factors on these. Finally, we calculate the formation rate of
pre-LMXBs. The results of this paper are used in the next one (Paper III) to

sparse solutions to underdetermined systems of linear equations and come with
strong performance guarantees. The LCA under study differs from the typical L1

it the potential to be implemented as a large-scale analog circuit.
  The goal of this paper is to give guarantees on the convergence time of the

economically sensible, in particular if reported vulnerabilities have been
actually exploited in the wild, and whether the risk score do actually match
the risk of actual exploitation.
  We compare the NVD dataset with two additional datasets, the EDB for the
white market of vulnerabilities (such as those present in Metasploit), and the
EKITS for the exploits traded in the black market. We benchmark them against
Symantec's threat explorer dataset (SYM) of actual exploit in the wild. We
analyze the whole spectrum of CVSS submetrics and use these characteristics to
perform a case-controlled analysis of CVSS scores (similar to those used to

negligible risk reduction, (b) the additional existence of proof of concepts

parameter. It emerges that moment (in)determinacy depends on the value of this
parameter: for some values, the distribution does not have finite moments of
all orders, hence the moment problem is not of interest in these cases. For

  Low-mass X-ray Binary Luminosity Function","submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Continuing our exploration of the collective properties of low-mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs) in the stellar fields of normal galaxies, we compute in this
paper the expected X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of LMXBs, starting from the
results of the previous paper in the series (Paper II). We treat separately two
classes of LMXB evolution, the first being close systems whose initial orbital
periods are below the bifurcation period, wherein the companion is on the main
sequence when Roche-lobe contact occurs, the subsequent evolution is driven by
angular-momentum loss from the system, and the second being wider systems whose
initial orbital periods are above the bifurcation period, wherein the companion
is on the giant branch when Roche-lobe contact occurs, and the evolution of
these systems is driven by the nuclear evolution of the companion. We obtain
model luminosity profiles L(t) for individual LMXBs of both classes. We then
compute the LMXB XLF by folding in the inputs for the pre-LMXB collective
properties and formation rates with the above luminosity profiles. Because of
the long timescale on which LMXBs evolve, one needs to keep track of the
evolution of the star-formation rate (SFR) on the same timescale, and we use
star-formation histories given by canonical models. We compare the observed
LMXB XLF with our computed one, keeping in mind that we have included only
neutron-star systems in this work, so that there would be an unaccounted-for
population of black-hole binaries at the high-luminosity end. We show that a
qualitative similarity already exists between the two, and we discuss the role
of the giant fraction, i.e., that fraction of all LMXBs which harbors a
low-mass giant companion, on the shape of the XLF at the high-luminosity end.

Galaxies. Haro11 displays complex emission line profiles, consisting of narrow
(FWHM<200 km/s) and broad (FWHM 200-300 km/s) components. We identify three
distinct emission knots kinematically connected to one another. A
chemodynamical analysis is presented, revealing that spatially resolved ionic
and elemental abundances do not agree with those derived from integrated
spectra across the galaxy. We conclude that this is almost certainly due to the
surface-brightness-weighting of electron temperature in integrated spectra,
leading to higher derived abundances. We find that the eastern knot has a low
gas density, but a higher temperature (by ~4,000 K) and consequently an oxygen
abundance ~0.4 dex lower than the neighbouring regions. A region of enhanced
N/O is found specifically in Knot C, confirming previous studies that found
anomalously high N/O ratios in this system. Maps of the Wolf-Rayet feature at
4686A reveal large WR populations (~900-1500 stars) in Knots A and B. The lack
of WR stars in Knot C, combined with an age of ~7.4 Myr suggest that a recently
completed WR phase may be responsible for the observed N/O excess. Conversely,
the absence of N-enriched gas and strong WR emission in Knots A and B suggests
we are observing these regions at an epoch where stellar ejecta has yet to cool

For these undoped materials it is well-established that the spin excitation
spectrum consists of a sharp, highly dispersive magnon spanning an energy range
of up to 200 meV (ref. 3). The fate of these high-energy magnetic modes upon
sizable doping is hitherto unresolved. Using resonant inelastic x-ray
scattering we show that optimally doped superconducting Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 retains
well defined, dispersive high-energy modes of magnetic origin. These paramagnon
modes are softer than, though as intense as, the magnon of undoped
antiferromagnetic BaFe2As2. The persistence of spin excitations well into the
superconducting phase suggests that, if spin fluctuations are responsible for
superconducting pairing, they originate from a distinctly correlated
spin-state. This connects Fe-pnictide superconductors to the high-Tc cuprates,
for which in spite of fundamental differences in the electronic structure,
similar paramagnon modes are present5.

models of stochastic gene expression. In gene expression models, the concept of
bursting is a production of several molecules simultaneously and is generally
represented as a compound Poisson process of random size. In a general
two-dimensional birth and death discrete model, we prove that under specific
assumptions and scaling (that are characteristics of the mRNA-protein system)
an adiabatic reduction leads to a one-dimensional discrete-state space model
with bursting production. The burst term appears through the reduction of the
first variable. In a two-dimensional continuous model, we also prove that an
adiabatic reduction can be performed in a stochastic slow/fast system. In this
gene expression model, the production of mRNA (the fast variable) is assumed to
be bursty and the production of protein (the slow variable) is linear as a
function of mRNA. When the dynamics of mRNA is assumed to be faster than the
protein dynamics (due to a mRNA degradation rate larger than for the protein)
we prove that, with the appropriate scaling, the bursting phenomena can be
transmitted to the slow variable. We show that the reduced equation is either a
stochastic differential equation with a jump Markov process or a deterministic
ordinary differential equation depending on the scaling that is appropriate.
  These results are significant because adiabatic reduction techniques seem to
have not been applied to a stochastic differential system containing a jump
Markov process. Last but not least, for our particular system, the adiabatic
reduction allows us to understand what are the necessary conditions for the
bursting production-like of protein to occur.

performance of putting and retrieving data in and out of cloud storage. We
first focus on measuring the delay performance of a very popular cloud storage
service Amazon S3. We establish that there is significant randomness in service
times for reading and writing small and medium size objects when assigned
distinct keys. We further demonstrate that using erasure coding, parallel
connections to storage cloud and limited chunking (i.e., dividing the object
into a few smaller objects) together pushes the envelope on service time
distributions significantly (e.g., 76%, 80%, and 85% reductions in mean, 90th,
and 99th percentiles for 2 Mbyte files) at the expense of additional storage
(e.g., 1.75x). However, chunking and erasure coding increase the load and hence
the queuing delays while reducing the supportable rate region in number of
requests per second per node. Thus, in the second part of our paper we focus on
analyzing the delay performance when chunking, FEC, and parallel connections
are used together. Based on this analysis, we develop load adaptive algorithms
that can pick the best code rate on a per request basis by using off-line
computed queue backlog thresholds. The solutions work with homogeneous services
with fixed object sizes, chunk sizes, operation type (e.g., read or write) as
well as heterogeneous services with mixture of object sizes, chunk sizes, and
operation types. We also present a simple greedy solution that
opportunistically uses idle connections and picks the erasure coding rate
accordingly on the fly. Both backlog and greedy solutions support the full rate
region and provide best mean delay performance when compared to the best fixed
coding rate policy. Our evaluations show that backlog based solutions achieve
better delay performance at higher percentile values than the greedy solution.

contributions from debris stars (formed in sub-galactic systems while they were

  integrals of birth-death processes",,,,"stat.ME q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many important stochastic counting models can be written as general
birth-death processes (BDPs). BDPs are continuous-time Markov chains on the
non-negative integers and can be used to easily parameterize a rich variety of
probability distributions. Although the theoretical properties of general BDPs
are well understood, traditionally statistical work on BDPs has been limited to
the simple linear (Kendall) process, which arises in ecology and evolutionary
applications. Aside from a few simple cases, it remains impossible to find
analytic expressions for the likelihood of a discretely-observed BDP, and
computational difficulties have hindered development of tools for statistical
inference. But the gap between BDP theory and practical methods for estimation
has narrowed in recent years. There are now robust methods for evaluating
likelihoods for realizations of BDPs: finite-time transition, first passage,
equilibrium probabilities, and distributions of summary statistics that arise
commonly in applications. Recent work has also exploited the connection between
continuously- and discretely-observed BDPs to derive EM algorithms for maximum
likelihood estimation. Likelihood-based inference for previously intractable
BDPs is much easier than previously thought and regression approaches analogous
to Poisson regression are straightforward to derive. In this review, we outline
the basic mathematical theory for BDPs and demonstrate new tools for
statistical inference using data from BDPs. We give six examples of BDPs and
derive EM algorithms to fit their parameters by maximum likelihood. We show how
to compute the distribution of integral summary statistics and give an example
application to the total cost of an epidemic. Finally, we suggest future
directions for innovation in this important class of stochastic processes.

it is the main purpose of this paper to introduce a novel, computationally
efficient, approach to graph clustering in the evolutionary context. Namely,
the method promoted in this article can be viewed as an incremental eigenvalue
solution for the spectral clustering method described by Ng. et al. (2001). The
incremental eigenvalue solution is a general technique for finding the
approximate eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix given a change. As well as
outlining the approach in detail, we present a theoretical bound on the quality
of the approximate eigenvectors using perturbation theory. We then derive a
novel spectral clustering algorithm called Incremental Approximate Spectral

is demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets modelling the evolution of

of scalar bosons in the NMSSM through the decays of a very light pseudoscalar.
The massive scalar has a mass around 126 GeV while the lighter one can have a
mass in the vicinity of 98 GeV (thus explaining an apparent LEP excess) or be
much lighter. The successive decay of this scalar pair into two light
pseudoscalars, followed by leptonic pseudoscalar decays, produces clean
multi-lepton final states with small or no missing energy. Furthermore, this
analysis offers an alternate leptonic probe for the 126 GeV scalar that can be
comparable with the ZZ* search channel. We emphasize that a dedicated
experimental search for multi-lepton final states can be an useful probe for
this scenario and, in general, for the NMSSM Higgs sector. We illustrate our
analysis with two representative benchmark points and show how the LHC
configuration with 8 TeV center-of-mass energy and 25 inverse femtobarns of
integrated luminosity can start testing this scenario, providing a good

generalization of the non-uniform sparse model with very mild assumptions. We
prove that when the measurements are obtained using a matrix with i.i.d
Gaussian entries, weighted $\ell_1$-minimization successfully recovers the
sparse signal from its measurements with overwhelming probability. We also
provide a method to choose these weights for any general signal model from the
non-uniform sparse class of signal models.

present Spitzer 10-35 um spectroscopic data centered at both stars, and
identify warm, unresolved excess emission in the close vicinity of Vega for the
first time. The properties of the warm excess in Vega are further characterized
with ancillary photometry in the mid infrared and resolved images in the
far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. The Vega warm excess shares many
similar properties with the one found around Fomalhaut. The emission shortward
of ~30 um from both warm components is well described as a blackbody emission
of ~170 K. Interestingly, two other systems, eps Eri and HR 8799, also show
such an unresolved warm dust using the same approach. These warm components may
be analogous to the solar system's zodiacal dust cloud, but of far greater. The
dust temperature and tentative detections in the submillimeter suggest the warm
excess arises from dust associated with a planetesimal ring located near the
water-frost line and presumably created by processes occurring at similar
locations in other debris systems as well. We also review the properties of the
2 um hot excess around Vega and Fomalhaut, showing that the dust responsible
for the hot excess is not spatially associated with the dust we detected in the
warm belt. We suggest it may arise from hot nano grains trapped in the magnetic
field of the star. Finally, the separation between the warm and cold belt is
rather large with an orbital ratio >~10 in all four systems. In light of the
current upper limits on the masses of planetary objects and the large gap, we

consider the detectable signatures of accretion from the interstellar medium
(ISM) that may be associated with such a population. We simulate the nearby
(radius 250 pc) part of this population, corresponding to the closest ~35 000
black holes, using current best estimates of the mass distribution of stellar
mass black holes combined with two models for the velocity distribution of
stellar-mass IBH which bracket likely possibilities. We distribute this
population of objects appropriately within the different phases of the ISM and
calculate the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate, modified by a further dimensionless
efficiency parameter \lambda. Assuming a simple prescription for radiatively
inefficient accretion at low Eddington ratios, we calculate the X-ray
luminosity of these objects, and similarly estimate the radio luminosity from
relations found empirically for black holes accreting at low rates. The latter
assumption depends crucially on whether or not the IBH accrete from the ISM in
a manner which is axisymmetric enough to produce jets. Comparing the predicted
X-ray fluxes with limits from hard X-ray surveys, we conclude that either the
Bondi-Hoyle efficiency parameter \lambda, is rather small (< 0.01), the
velocities of the IBH are rather high, or some combination of both. The
predicted radio flux densities correspond to a population of objects which,
while below current survey limits, should be detectable with the Square
Kilometre Array (SKA). Converting the simulated space velocities into proper
motions, we further demonstrate that such IBH could be identified as faint high

present day. The resimulated density field thus obtained accurately matches the
original density field of the Millennium simulation in the density range 0.3 <=
rho/rho_mean <= 20 without any significant bias. Especially, the Fourier phases
of the resimulated density fields are tightly correlated with those of the
original simulation down to a scale corresponding to a wavenumber of ~ 1 h/Mpc,
much smaller than the translinear scale, which corresponds to a wavenumber of ~
0.15 h\Mpc.

they can mix different tree-level amplitudes. Moreover, even small mass

implement the relativistic notion of causality and to define a notion of time

level the metric is Riemannian, i.e. locally Euclidean, and that the Lorentzian
structure, that we usually consider as fundamental, is in fact an effective
property that emerges in some regions of a 4-dimensional space with a positive
definite metric. In such a model, there is no dynamics nor signature flip
across some hypersurface; instead, all the fields develop a Lorentzian dynamics
in these regions because they propagate in an effective metric. It is shown
that one can construct a decent classical field theory for scalars, vectors and
(Dirac) spinors in flat spacetime. It is then shown that gravity can be
included but that the theory for the effective Lorentzian metric is not general
relativity but of the covariant Galileon type. The constraints arising from
stability, the equivalence principle and the constancy of fundamental constants
are detailed and a phenomenological picture of the emergence of the Lorentzian
metric is also given. The construction, while restricted to classical fields in

theory in which entropy is a measure of uncertainty. We propose that the
Maxwellian velocity distribution should more properly be regarded as a limiting
distribution which is identical with the distribution across particles in the
asymptotic limit of large numbers. In smaller systems, the distribution across
particles differs from the limiting distribution and fluctuates. Therefore the
entropy can be calculated either from the actual distribution across the
particles or from the limiting distribution. The former fluctuates with the
distribution but the latter does not. However, only the latter represents
uncertainty in the sense implied by information theory by accounting for all
possible microstates. We also argue that the Maxwellian probability
distribution for the velocity of a single particle should be regarded as a
limiting distribution. Therefore the entropy of a single particle is well
defined, as is the entropy of an N-particle system, regardless of the
microstate. We argue that the meaning of the H-theorem is to reveal the
underlying distribution in the limit of large numbers. Computer simulations of

generations and for constraining Galactic bulge formation models, at present
little is known about the metal-poor stellar content of the central Milky Way.
This is a consequence of the great distances involved and intervening dust
obscuration, which challenge optical studies. However, the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), a wide-area, multifiber,
high-resolution spectroscopic survey within Sloan Digital Sky Survey III
(SDSS-III), is exploring the chemistry of all Galactic stellar populations at
infrared wavelengths, with particular emphasis on the disk and the bulge. An
automated spectral analysis of data on 2,403 giant stars in twelve fields in
the bulge obtained during APOGEE commissioning yielded five stars with low
metallicity([Fe/H]$\le-1.7$), including two that are very metal-poor
[Fe/H]$\sim-2.1$ by bulge standards.
  Luminosity-based distance estimates place the five stars within the outer
bulge, where other 1,246 of the analyzed stars may reside. A manual reanalysis
of the spectra verifies the low metallicities, and finds these stars to be
enhanced in the $\alpha$-elements O, Mg, and Si without significant
$\alpha$-pattern differences with other local halo or metal-weak thick-disk
stars of similar metallicity, or even with other more metal-rich bulge stars.
While neither the kinematics nor chemistry of these stars can yet definitively
determine which, if any, are truly bulge members, rather than denizens of other
populations co-located with the bulge, the newly-identified stars reveal that
the chemistry of metal-poor stars in the central Galaxy resembles that of
metal-weak thick-disk stars at similar metallicity.

  Some of the most promising single-degenerate type Ia progenitors are
recurrent novae and super-soft sources (SSS). White dwarfs with higher mass
transfer rates can also be type Ia supernova progenitors. For these rapidly
accreting white dwarfs (RAWD), more material than is needed for steady burning
accretes on the white dwarf, and extends the white dwarf's photosphere. Unlike
super-soft sources, such objects will likely not be detectable at soft X-ray
energies, but will be bright at longer wavelengths, such as the far ultraviolet
(UV). Possible examples include LMC N66 and the V Sagittae stars.
  We present a survey using multi-object spectrographs looking for RAWD in the
central core of the SMC, from objects selected to be bright in the far UV and
with blue far UV-V colors. While we find some unusual objects, and recover
known planetary nebula and WR stars, we detect no candidate RAWD. The upper
limits from this non-detection depending on our expectations of what a RAWD

Assuming they resemble LMC N66 or fainter versions of Wolf-Rayet stars we set
an upper limit of 10-14 RAWD in the SMC. However, our survey is unlikely to
detect objects like V Sge, and hence we cannot set meaningful upper limits if

our method does not require an iterative calculation of the optimal weights.
Because of this, the proposed scheme, while not designed specifically to
maximize the sum rate, is computationally efficient and achieves a faster

sparse spatial signals with changing sparsity patterns, as well as other
unknown states, from a sequence of nonlinear observations corrupted by
(possibly) non-Gaussian noise. In many applications, particularly those in
visual tracking, the unknown state can be split into a small dimensional part,
e.g. global motion, and a spatial signal, e.g. illumination or shape
deformation. The spatial signal is often well modeled as being sparse in some
domain. For a long sequence, its sparsity pattern can change over time,
although the changes are usually slow. To address the above problem, we propose
a novel solution approach called Particle Filtered Modified-CS (PaFiMoCS). The
key idea of PaFiMoCS is to importance sample for the small dimensional state
vector, while replacing importance sampling by slow sparsity pattern change
constrained posterior mode tracking for recovering the sparse spatial signal.
We show that the problem of tracking moving objects across spatially varying
illumination change is an example of the above problem and explain how to
design PaFiMoCS for it. Experiments on both simulated data as well as on real
videos with significant illumination changes demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithm as compared with existing particle filter based tracking

because meaningful input for Dung's abstract frameworks is provided in that

from a given knowledge base, a set of arguments and to identify the conflicts
between them. The resulting network is then evaluated by means of
extension-based semantics on an abstract level, i.e. on the resulting graph.
While several systems are nowadays available for the latter step, the
automation of the instantiation process itself has received less attention. In
this work, we provide a novel approach to construct and visualize an
argumentation framework from a given knowledge base. The system we propose
relies on Answer-Set Programming and follows a two-step approach. A first
program yields the logic-based arguments as its answer-sets; a second program
is then used to specify the relations between arguments based on the
answer-sets of the first program. As it turns out, this approach not only
allows for a flexible and extensible tool for instantiation-based
argumentation, but also provides a new method for answer-set visualization in

of the most successful and widely applied techniques for the solution of
NP-complete problems. The aim of this paper is to investigate theoretically how
Sat can be utilized for the efficient solution of problems that are harder than
NP or co-NP. In particular, we consider the fundamental reasoning problems in
propositional disjunctive answer set programming (ASP), Brave Reasoning and
Skeptical Reasoning, which ask whether a given atom is contained in at least
one or in all answer sets, respectively. Both problems are located at the
second level of the Polynomial Hierarchy and thus assumed to be harder than NP
or co-NP. One cannot transform these two reasoning problems into SAT in
polynomial time, unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses. We show that
certain structural aspects of disjunctive logic programs can be utilized to
break through this complexity barrier, using new techniques from Parameterized
Complexity. In particular, we exhibit transformations from Brave and Skeptical
Reasoning to SAT that run in time O(2^k n^2) where k is a structural parameter
of the instance and n the input size. In other words, the reduction is
fixed-parameter tractable for parameter k. As the parameter k we take the size
of a smallest backdoor with respect to the class of normal (i.e.,
disjunction-free) programs. Such a backdoor is a set of atoms that when deleted
makes the program normal. In consequence, the combinatorial explosion, which is
expected when transforming a problem from the second level of the Polynomial
Hierarchy to the first level, can now be confined to the parameter k, while the
running time of the reduction is polynomial in the input size n, where the
order of the polynomial is independent of k.

identified at least two different ways in which the former extends the latter.
First, ASP program typically contain sets of rules that can be naturally
interpreted as inductive definitions, and the language FO(ID) has shown that
such inductive definitions can elegantly be added to classical logic in a
modular way. Second, there is of course also the well-known epistemic component
of ASP, which was mainly emphasized in the early papers on stable model
semantics. To investigate whether this kind of knowledge can also, and in a
similarly modular way, be added to classical logic, the language of Ordered
Epistemic Logic was presented in recent work. However, this logic views the
epistemic component as entirely separate from the inductive definition
component, thus ignoring any possible interplay between the two. In this paper,
we present a language that extends the inductive definition construct found in
FO(ID) with an epistemic component, making such interplay possible. The
eventual goal of this work is to discover whether it is really appropriate to
view the epistemic component and the inductive definition component of ASP as
two separate extensions of classical logic, or whether there is also something
of importance in the combination of the two.

presence of a boson star, a compact object made up of scalar particles, as both
objects are far more compact than the scale of current observational
constraints. While a boson star in the galactic center is disfavored for a
number of theoretical considerations, we outline the first test that can
directly observe a boson star. We accomplish this by studying the strong
gravitational lensing of S stars resulting from the assumption of a boson star
in the Galactic Center. Boson stars have an extended mass distribution and are
transparent to electromagnetic radiation, giving rise to a radial caustic
curve. We calculate the brightness of images formed by stars crossing these
radial caustics and show that a boson star would give rise to much brighter
images than a black hole with a similar mass and that those images would be
easily bright enough to be detected with upcoming instruments.

reveals that the large difference in spin gaps is purely due to different spin

with different energy widths for the c-axis and in-plane spin excitations. The

radio emission from the giant lobes of the nearest radio galaxy, Centaurus A.
After removal of the smooth Galactic foreground RM component, using an ensemble
of background source RMs located outside the giant lobes, we are left with a
residual RM signal associated with the giant lobes. We find the most likely
origin of this residual RM is from thermal material mixed throughout the
relativistic lobe plasma. The alternative possibility of a thin-skin/boundary
layer of magnetoionic material swept up by the expansion of the lobes is highly
unlikely since it requires, at least, an order of magnitude enhancement of the
swept up gas over the expected intragroup density on these scales. Strong
depolarisation observed from 2.3 to 0.96 GHz also supports the presence of a
significant amount of thermal gas within the lobes; although depolarisation
solely due to RM fluctuations in a foreground Faraday screen on scales smaller
than the beam cannot be ruled out. Considering the internal Faraday rotation
scenario, we find a thermal gas number density of ~10^{-4} cm^{-3} implying a
total gas mass of ~10^{10} M_solar within the lobes. The thermal pressure
associated with this gas (with temperature kT ~ 0.5 keV, obtained from recent
X-ray results) is approximately equal to the non-thermal pressure, indicating
that over the volume of the lobes, there is approximate equipartition between
the thermal gas, radio-emitting electrons and magnetic field (and potentially
any relativistic protons present).

The super trace of the heat kernel interpolates so the Euler-Poincare formula

generally, for any continuous complex valued function f satisfying f(0)=0, one
has the formula chi(G) = str(exp(f(D))). This includes for example the
Schroedinger evolutions chi(G) = str(cos(t D)) on the graph. After stating some

closed paths of length n starting at an even dimensional simplex is the same
than the number of closed paths of length n starting at an odd dimensional
simplex. We give a couple of worked out examples and see that McKean-Singer

  Cross-correlation","3 pages",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image subtraction in astronomy is a tool for transient object discovery and
characterization, particularly useful in wide fields, and is well suited for
moving or photometrically varying objects such as asteroids, extra-solar
planets and supernovae. A convolution technique is used to match point spread
functions (PSFs) between images of the same field taken at different times
prior to pixel-by-pixel subtraction. Particularly suitable for large-scale
images is a spatially-varying kernel, where the convolution is allowed to adapt
to PSF changes as a function of position within the images. The most versatile
basis for fitting the spatially-varying kernel is the Dirac delta function.
However, the convolution kernel based on the delta function does not
discriminate between pixel scale noise variations and the intended stellar
point spread function signals. The situation can frequently lead to reduced
signal to noise ratios for variable objects detectable in the resulting
subtraction. This work presents a cross-correlation method for reducing noise
effects on the delta function derived convolution kernels, thus yielding
significantly improved signal to noise in the resulting subtraction.

drives dynamo activities by generating disk magnetic fields with opposite

azimuthal magnetic flux from the disk and the subsequent amplification of disk

from lower-dimensional data, whose components represent partial information
about the signal, utilizing prior knowledge on the sparsity of the signal. For
further reducing the data size of the compressed expression, a scheme to
recover the original signal utilizing only the sign of each entry of the
linearly transformed vector was recently proposed. This approach is often
termed the 1-bit compressed sensing. Here we analyze the typical performance of
an L1-norm based signal recovery scheme for the 1-bit compressed sensing using
statistical mechanics methods. We show that the signal recovery performance
predicted by the replica method under the replica symmetric ansatz, which turns
out to be locally unstable for modes breaking the replica symmetry, is in a
good consistency with experimental results of an approximate recovery algorithm
developed earlier. This suggests that the L1-based recovery problem typically
has many local optima of a similar recovery accuracy, which can be achieved by
the approximate algorithm. We also develop another approximate recovery
algorithm inspired by the cavity method. Numerical experiments show that when
the density of nonzero entries in the original signal is relatively large the
new algorithm offers better performance than the abovementioned scheme and does
so with a lower computational cost.

Proving a super-polynomial lower bound for the size of nondeterministic thrifty
branching programs (NTBP) would separate $NL$ from $P$ for thrifty models
solving the tree evaluation problem. First, we show that {\em Read-Once NTBPs}
are equivalent to whole black-white pebbling algorithms thus showing a tight
lower bound (ignoring polynomial factors) for this model.
  We then introduce a weaker restriction of NTBPs called {\em Bitwise
Independence}. The best known NTBPs (of size $O(k^{h/2+1})$) for the tree
evaluation problem given by Cook et. al. (2012) are Bitwise Independent. As our
main result, we show that any Bitwise Independent NTBP solving $TEP_{2}^{h}(k)$
must have at least $\frac{1}{2}k^{h/2}$ states. Prior to this work, lower
bounds were known for NTBPs only for fixed heights $h=2,3,4$ (See Cook et. al.
(2012)). We prove our results by associating a fractional black-white pebbling
strategy with any bitwise independent NTBP solving the Tree Evaluation Problem.
Such a connection was not known previously even for fixed heights.
  Our main technique is the entropy method introduced by Jukna and Z{\'a}k
(2001) originally in the context of proving lower bounds for read-once
branching programs. We also show that the previous lower bounds given by Cook
et. al. (2012) for deterministic branching programs for Tree Evaluation Problem
can be obtained using this approach. Using this method, we also show tight
lower bounds for any $k$-way deterministic branching program solving Tree
Evaluation Problem when the instances are restricted to have the same group
operation in all internal nodes.

$\mathbf{Z}=(Z_1,...,Z_d)^T$ and $\mathbf{Z}_{-d}=(Z_1,...,Z_{d-1})^T$, the
method approximates the conditional distribution of
$[Z_d|\mathbf{Z}_{-d}=\mathbf{z}_{-d}]$ when $|\mathbf{z}_{-d}|>r_*$. The
approach is based on the assumption that $\mathbf{Z}$ is a multivariate
regularly varying random vector of dimension $d$. The conditional distribution
approximation relies on knowledge of the angular measure of $\mathbf{Z}$, which
provides explicit structure for dependence in the distribution's tail. As the
method produces a predictive distribution rather than just a point predictor,
one can answer any question posed about the quantity being predicted, and, in
particular, one can assess how well the extreme behavior is represented. Using
a fitted model for the angular measure, we apply our method to nitrogen dioxide

development of these mechanisms during cyclic loading, three low-cycle fatigue
tests were performed and stopped at different stages. The first test was
stopped after the first cycle; the second one was stopped after 40 cycles,
corresponding to the beginning of the stabilisation of the cyclic strain-stress
behaviour; and the last one was carried out to failure (3324 cycles). Submitted
to fatigue loading, the response of the TiNi shape memory alloy presents a
classical pseudoelastic response. Two deformation mechanisms, identified by TEM
observations, are highlighted, the first one by twins and the second by
dislocation slip and its interaction with precipitates. These two mechanisms
evolve without competition during cyclic loading. The nanomechanical properties
of the alloy were also examined, and the evolution of the microhardness or

accurate remainder term in calculations of the distribution of primes in
residue classes. Using it in Rubinstein and Sarnak's method estimates the
limiting logarithmic frequency of pi(x)>Li(x) as 0.00000026300 with only 5 zeta
zeros used explicitly, and a reliable value between 0.000000262996732 and
0.000000262996733 is obtained with fewer than 100 zeros. Accurate results for
""prime number races"" can usually be obtained with explicit use of only the
first zero of each L-function involved, thus bringing out their dependence on
those zeros. For extreme deviations, the method of steepest descent can be
applied, and the remainder approximated by an explicit formula together with a
rapidly convergent series. This gives, for example, 8.649*10^(-12477) for the
logarithmic frequency of pi(x)>Li(x)+5*Li(sqrt(x)). The Monach - Lamzouri model
of the extreme distribution is developed to give close agreement with these
results. The remainder can also be calculated explicitly as an asymptotic
series. This allows good modelling of non-extreme races and the calculation of
distributions by direct convolution. The three different methods agree to
within 0.001% where they overlap in application. The distribution calculated
from values of pi(x) for x<10^20 shows similar behaviour to the limiting
distribution, but is somewhat further from normal.

resistivity becomes much reduced when electric fields are applied to the
direction of the momentum vector to connect two paired Weyl points. Performing
the renormalization group analysis, we find that the distance between two Weyl
points becomes enhanced logarithmically at low temperatures although the
coupling constant of such interactions vanishes inverse-logarithmically.
Considering the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly, scattering between these two Weyl
points becomes suppressed to increase electrical conductivity in the
""longitudinal"" direction, counter-intuitive in the respect that interactions
are expected to reduce metallicity. We also propose that the anomalous
contribution in the Hall effect shows the logarithmic enhancement as a function
of temperature, originating from the fact that the anomalous Hall coefficient
turns out to be proportional to the distance between two paired Weyl points.
Correlations with topological constraints allow unexpected and exotic transport

(high-Mach number) collisionless shock waves that form when stellar debris
rapidly expands after a supernova. Collisionless shock waves also form in the
flow of particles from the Sun (the solar wind), and extensive spacecraft
observations have established that electron acceleration at these shocks is
effectively absent whenever the upstream magnetic field is roughly parallel to
the shock surface normal (quasi-parallel conditions). However, it is unclear
whether this magnetic dependence of electron acceleration also applies to the
far stronger shocks around young supernova remnants, where local magnetic
conditions are poorly understood. Here we present Cassini spacecraft
observations of an unusually strong solar system shock wave (Saturn's bow
shock) where significant local electron acceleration has been confirmed under
quasi-parallel magnetic conditions for the first time, contradicting the
established magnetic dependence of electron acceleration at solar system
shocks. Furthermore, the acceleration led to electrons at relativistic energies
(~MeV), comparable to the highest energies ever attributed to
shock-acceleration in the solar wind. These observations demonstrate that at
high-Mach numbers, like those of young supernova remnant shocks, quasi-parallel
shocks become considerably more effective electron accelerators.

and the population performs an uphill walk on the fitness landscape until a

the fitness difference between successive steps follows a pattern of
diminishing returns in the Weibull domain and accelerating returns in the
Fr{\'e}chet domain, as the initial fitness of the population is increased.
These trends are found to be robust with respect to fitness correlations. We
believe that this result can be exploited in experiments to determine the
extreme value domain of the distribution of beneficial fitness effects. Our
work here differs significantly from the previous ones that assume the

missing values estimation on two-dimensional grids by means of spatial

spatial correlations are captured in terms of interactions between the spins.

prediction sites) is estimated from the sample-based correlations. We
investigate the performance of the spin classifiers in terms of computational
speed, misclassification rate, class histogram and spatial correlations
reproduction using simulated realizations of spatial random fields, real
rainfall data, and a digital test image. We also compare the spin-based methods
with standard classifiers such as the k-nearest neighbor, the fuzzy k-nearest

evolution is poorly understood theoretically. In such systems Kozai cycles can
be induced in the inner binary system during which the inner orbit eccentricity
and the inclination between both binary orbits vary periodically. These cycles,
combined with tidal friction and gravitational wave emission, can significantly
affect the inner binary evolution. To investigate these effects quantitatively
we perform a population synthesis study of triple systems and focus on
evolutionary paths that lead to mergers of carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs
(WDs), which constitute an important candidate progenitor channel for type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia). We approach this problem by Monte Carlo sampling from
observation-based distributions of systems within the primary mass range 1.0 -
6.5 M_Sun and inner orbit semi-major axes a_1 and eccentricities e_1 satisfying
a_1 (1-e_1^2) > 12 AU, i.e. non-interacting in the absence of a tertiary
component. We evolve these systems by means of a newly developed algorithm that
couples secular triple dynamics with an existing binary population synthesis
code. We find that the tertiary significantly alters the inner binary evolution
in about 24% of all sampled systems. In particular, we find several channels
leading to CO WD mergers. Amongst these is a novel channel in which a collision
occurs in wide inner binary systems as a result of extremely high
eccentricities induced by Kozai cycles. With assumptions on which CO WD mergers
lead to a SN Ia explosion we estimate the SNe Ia delay time distribution
resulting from triples and compare to a binary population synthesis study and
to observations. Although we find that our triple rate is low, we have
determined a lower limit of the triple-induced SNe Ia rate and further study is
needed that includes triples with initially tighter inner orbits.

polarizations and get so called nonlinear wave equation in frequency domain
(NWEF), which is based on Maxwell wave equation and using slowly varying
spectral amplitude approximation. The NWEF is generalized in concept as it
directly describes the electric field dynamics rather than the envelope
dynamics and because it concludes most current-interested nonlinear processes
such as three-wave mixing, four-wave-mixing and material Raman effects. We give
two sets of NWEF, one is a 1+1D equation describing the (approximated) planar
wave propagation in nonlinear bulk material and the other corresponds to the

the effect of a possible change in the nucleon-nucleon interaction on nuclear
reaction rates involving the A=5 (5Li and 5He) and A=8 (8Be) unstable nuclei.
The reaction rates for 3He(d,p)4He and 3H(d,n)4He are dominated by the
properties of broad analog resonances in 5Li and 5He compound nuclei
respectively. While the triple-alpha process 4He(aa,g)12C is normally not
effective in BBN, its rate is very sensitive to the position of the ""Hoyle

BBN. We found that the effect of the variation of constants on the 3He(d,p)4He,
3H(d,n)4He nd 4He(aa,g)12C reaction rates is not sufficient to induce a
significant effect on BBN, even with a stable 8Be. The main influences come
from the weak rates and the A=2, n(p,g)d, bottleneck reaction.

protostellar disk around a solar-type star, varying the disk temperature,
surface density profile, and dust-to-gas ratio. We also consider stellar masses
between 0.4 and 2 $M_\odot$, with corresponding adjustments in the disk mass

number criterion with conductivities including the contributions from ions,
electrons, and charged fractal dust aggregates. The charged species' abundances
are found using the approach proposed by S. Okuzumi. The dead zone is in most
cases defined by the ambipolar diffusion. In our maps, the dead zone takes a
variety of shapes, including a fish-tail pointing away from the star and
islands located on and off the midplane. The corresponding accretion rates vary
with radius, indicating locations where the surface density will increase over
time, and others where it will decrease. We show that density bumps do not
readily grow near the dead zone's outer edge, independently of the disk
parameters and the dust properties. Instead, the accretion rate peaks at the
radius where the gas-phase metals freeze out. This could lead to clearing a
valley in the surface density, and to a trap for pebbles located just outside
the metal freeze-out line.

at lower metallicities. These new models and the available observations show
that massive C-O core AGB stars in our Galaxy and in the Magellanic Clouds
experience considerable third dredge-up (TDU). Thus, if massive AGB stars at
the metallicities of the Globular Clusters (GCs) also experience deep TDU, then
these stars would not be good candidates to explain the abundance anomalies
observed in most GCs. However, more massive AGB stars (e.g., near the limit of
C-O core production) or super-AGB stars with O-Ne cores may not experience very
efficient TDU, producing the high He abundances needed to explain the multiple

vectors are set-valued. Furthermore, it is reasonable to include the exchange
rules in the argument of the risk measure and so consider risk measures of
set-valued portfolios. This situation includes the classical Kabanov's
transaction costs model, where the set-valued portfolio is given by the sum of
a random vector and an exchange cone, but also a number of further cases of
additional liquidity constraints.
  We suggest a definition of the risk measure based on calling a set-valued
portfolio acceptable if it possesses a selection with all individually
acceptable marginals. The obtained selection risk measure is coherent (or
convex), law invariant and has values being upper convex closed sets. We
describe the dual representation of the selection risk measure and suggest
efficient ways of approximating it from below and from above. In case of
Kabanov's exchange cone model, it is shown how the selection risk measure

project, including all observations, the analysis method, and the initial
results of the survey. We study the thermal dust emission of 12 previously
well-characterized, isolated, nearby globules using FIR and submm continuum
maps at up to eight wavelengths between 100 micron and 1.2 mm. Our sample
contains both globules with starless cores and embedded protostars at different
early evolutionary stages. The dust emission maps are used to extract spatially
resolved SEDs, which are then fit independently with modified blackbody curves
to obtain line-of-sight-averaged dust temperature and column density maps. We
find that the thermal structure of all globules is dominated by external
heating from the interstellar radiation field and moderate shielding by thin
extended halos. All globules have warm outer envelopes (14-20 K) and colder
dense interiors (8-12 K). The protostars embedded in some of the globules raise
the local temperature of the dense cores only within radii out to about 5000
AU, but do not significantly affect the overall thermal balance of the
globules.

simplicial rings, $A_\infty$ spaces, $E_\infty$ ring spectra, etc.---are often
equivalent to categories of algebras over some monad or triple $T$. In such
cases, $T$ is acting on a nice simplicial model category in such a way that $T$
descends to a monad on the homotopy category and defines a category of homotopy
$T$-algebras. In this setting there is a forgetful functor from the homotopy
category of $T$-algebras to the category of homotopy $T$-algebras.
  Under suitable hypotheses we provide an obstruction theory, in the form of a
Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence, for lifting a homotopy $T$-algebra map to a
strict map of $T$-algebras. Once we have a map of $T$-algebras to serve as a
basepoint, the spectral sequence computes the homotopy groups of the space of
$T$-algebra maps and the edge homomorphism on $\pi_0$ is the aforementioned
forgetful functor. We discuss a variety of settings in which the required
hypotheses are satisfied, including monads arising from algebraic theories and
operads. We also give sufficient conditions for the $E_2$-term to be calculable
in terms of Quillen cohomology groups.

Combin. 58(1) (2014) 127--136",,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is Hamiltonian if it contains a spanning cycle,
and pancyclic if it contains cycles of all lengths from 3 to $n$. In 1984, Fan
presented a degree condition involving every pair of vertices at distance two
for a 2-connected graph to be Hamiltonian. Motivated by Fan's result, we say
that an induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ is $f_1$-heavy if for every pair of
vertices $u,v\in V(H)$, $d_{H}(u,v)=2$ implies $\max\{d(u),d(v)\}\geq (n+1)/2$.
For a given graph $R$, $G$ is called $R$-$f_1$-heavy if every induced subgraph
of $G$ isomorphic to $R$ is $f_1$-heavy. In this paper we show that for a
connected graph $S$ with $S\neq P_3$ and a 2-connected claw-$f_1$-heavy graph
$G$ which is not a cycle, $G$ being $S$-$f_1$-heavy implies $G$ is pancyclic if
$S=P_4,Z_1$ or $Z_2$, where claw is $K_{1,3}$ and $Z_i$ is the path
$a_1a_2a_3... a_{i+2}a_{i+3}$ plus the edge $a_1a_3$. Our result partially
improves a previous theorem due to Bedrossian on pancyclicity of 2-connected
graphs.

on the disk's thermodynamic state, where the internal dissipation is balanced
by radiative transport, and the migration can be directed outwards, a process
which extends the lifetime of growing embryos. Very important parameters
determining the structure of disks, and hence the direction of migration, are
the viscosity and the adiabatic index. In this paper we investigate the
influence of different viscosity prescriptions (alpha-type and constant) and
adiabatic indices on disk structures and how this affects the migration rate of
planets embedded in such disks. We perform 3D numerical simulations of
accretion disks with embedded planets. We use the explicit/implicit
hydrodynamical code NIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and radiation
transport in the flux-limited diffusion approximation, as well as a proper
equation of state for molecular hydrogen. The migration of embedded 20Earthmass
planets is studied. Low-viscosity disks have cooler temperatures and the
migration rates of embedded planets tend toward the isothermal limit. In these
disks, planets migrate inwards even in the fully radiative case. The effect of
outward migration can only be sustained if the viscosity in the disk is large.
Overall, the differences between the treatments for the equation of state seem
to play a more important role in disks with higher viscosity. A change in the
adiabatic index and in the viscosity changes the zero-torque radius that
separates inward from outward migration. For larger viscosities, temperatures
in the disk become higher and the zero-torque radius moves to larger radii,
allowing outward migration of a 20 Earth-mass planet to persist over an
extended radial range. In combination with large disk masses, this may allow
for an extended period of the outward migration of growing protoplanetary
cores.

and atmospheric modeling of stars with initial masses between 20 Msun and 120

massive stars. Rather, they have remarkable similarities with rare, unstable
massive stars known as Luminous Blue Variables (LBV). While observations show
that some SNe seem to have had LBVs as progenitors, no theoretical model had
yet predicted that a star could explode at this stage. Our models provide
theoretical support for relatively low-luminosity LBVs exploding as SN in the
framework of single stellar evolution. This is a significant shift in paradigm,
meaning that a fraction of LBVs could be the end stage of massive star
evolution, rather than a transitory evolutionary phase. We suggest that type
IIb SN could have LBV as progenitors, and a prime example could be SN 2008ax.

perturbation, produced by the turbulent deflagration, turns into a shock down
of the gradient, where it will dissipate and heat up the media. With the right
frequency and amplitude the heating can be enough to initiate a detonation,
which can propagate backward and up the density gradient. We studied planar and
spherical geometry. In the planar case we made a parametric study of the
frequency and amplitude. We found it possible to obtain a detonation for
perturbations down to Mach number M=0.003. In the spherical case, geometrical
damping makes it harder to initiate a detonation, but considering a small He
atmosphere (<0.01 Msol) makes it possible again to obtain a detonation down to
small perturbation (M=0.002). In the context of thermonuclear supernovae, this
could be a mean to turn a turbulent flame producing sound waves to a

groups. Their extraction, dynamics and evolution. One year ago the method for
group evolution discovery (GED) was introduced. The GED method during
extraction process takes into account both the group members quality and
quantity. The quality is reflected by user importance measure. In this paper
the influence of different user importance measures on the results of the GED
method is examined and presented. The results indicate that using global
measures like social position (page rank) allows to achieve more precise
results than using local measures like degree centrality or no measure at all.

bounded Sobolev extension domain, a special Lipschitz domain, and an unbounded

global Gaussian bounds for Neumann Green's function under an additional
assumption that weak solutions with zero Neumann data satisfy a local
boundedness estimate. In the scalar case, such a local boundedness estimate is
a consequence of De Giorgi-Moser-Nash theory holds for equations with bounded
measurable coefficients in Sobolev extension domains, while in the vectorial

the world of Differential Harnack inequalities, which have been so influential
in geometric analysis and probability theory over the past few decades. At the
coarsest level, these are often mysterious-looking inequalities that hold for
`positive' solutions of some parabolic PDE, and can be verified quickly by
grinding out a computation and applying a maximum principle. In this note we
emphasise the geometry behind the Harnack inequalities, which typically turn
out to be assertions of the convexity of some natural object. As an
application, we explain how Hamilton's Differential Harnack inequality for mean
curvature flow of a $n$-dimensional submanifold of $R^{n+1}$ can be viewed as
following directly from the well-known preservation of convexity under mean
curvature flow, but this time of a $(n+1)$-dimensional submanifold of
$R^{n+2}$. We also briefly survey the earlier work that led us to these
observations.

of the primordial non-Gaussianity fnl parameter -- detectable on future Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) high--resolution anisotropy maps -- produced by
unresolved extragalactic point sources at frequencies of cosmological interest
(45--375 GHz). We consider two scenarios: an ideal (noiseless) mission and a
possible future space-borne satellite, with instrumental characteristics
similar to the ones proposed for the Cosmic Origins Explorer (COrE). The local,
equilateral, orthogonal and flat shapes are considered in both temperature
(intensity) and polarized emission data. The angular power spectrum and
bispectrum of extragalactic point sources are estimated by state-of-the-art
models of source number counts. The impact of all the most relevant (far--IR
and radio selected) source populations on these shapes at COrE frequencies is
studied. The results of this analysis show that unresolved extragalactic point
sources should not induce a very relevant non-Gaussian signal in the frequency
range 100--200 GHz, thus not preventing a correct estimate of the CMB
primordial fnl parameter. Polarization information allows one to significantly
reduce the error--bars in the fnl parameter and the bias induced by unresolved
sources and, hence, to widen the range of frequencies for fnl studies. On the
contrary, at nu < 100 GHz or nu > 225 GHz, important non-Gaussian deviations in
CMB anisotropy maps are expected due to unresolved extragalactic sources.

sub-wavelength localization via adiabatic passage (SLAP) technique. We consider
a sample of ultracold neutral atoms loaded into a two-dimensional optical
lattice with one atom per site. Each atom is modeled by a three-level
\Lambda-system in interaction with a pump and a Stokes laser pulse. Using a
pump field with a node in its spatial profile, the atoms at all sites are
transferred from one ground state of the system to the other via stimulated
Raman adiabatic passage, except the one at the position of the node that
remains in the initial ground state. This technique allows for the preparation,
manipulation, and detection of atoms with a spatial resolution better than the
diffraction limit, which either relaxes the requirements on the optical setup
used or extends the achievable spatial resolution to lattice spacings smaller
than accessible to date. In comparison to techniques based on coherent
population trapping, SLAP gives a higher addressing resolution and has
additional advantages such as robustness against parameter variations,
coherence of the transfer process, and the absence of photon induced recoil.
Additionally, the advantages of our proposal with respect to adiabatic
spin-flip techniques are highlighted. Analytic expressions for the achievable
addressing resolution and efficiency are derived and compared to numerical
simulations for Rb-87 atoms in state-of-the-art optical lattices.

  In this paper, a new model, where the storage nodes are placed in two racks,

hierarchical structure of the generated extremal regions serves as a starting
point for agglomerative clustering of the fingertips into hands. Furthermore, a
heuristic is suggested that supports the identification of individual fingers
as well as the distinction between left hands and right hands if all five
fingers of a hand are in contact with the touch surface.
  The evaluation confirmed that the system is robust against detection errors

light to saturate the correct value of the electroweak scale by its condensate.
Within the seesaw scenario the neutrinos can have their Dirac masses large
enough so that their condensates can provide significant contribution to the
value of the electroweak scale. We address the question of a phenomenological
feasibility of the top-quark and neutrino condensation conspiracy against the
electroweak symmetry. Mandatory is to reproduce the masses of electroweak gauge
bosons, the top-quark mass and the recently observed scalar mass of
$125\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and to satisfy the upper limits on absolute value of active
neutrino masses. To accomplish that we design a reasonably simplified effective
model with two composite Higgs doublets. Additionally, we work with a general
number $N$ of right-handed neutrino flavor triplets participating on the seesaw
mechanism. There are no experimental constraints limiting this number. The
upper limit is set by the model itself. Provided that the condensation scale is
of order $10^{17-18}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and the number of right-handed neutrinos is

during embryonic development in a diverse group of metazoan animals:
representatives of vertebrates (Danio rerio, Xenopus tropicalis), a chordate
(Ciona intestinalis) and invertebrate phyla such as insects (Drosophila
melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae) and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) were
sampled, The different species showed overall very similar TF expression
patterns, with TF expression increasing during the initial stages of
development. C2H2 zinc finger TFs were over-represented and Homeobox TFs were
under-represented in the early stages in all species. We further clustered TFs
for each species based on their quantitative temporal expression profiles. This
showed very similar TF expression trends in development in vertebrate and
insect species. However, analysis of the expression of orthologous pairs
between more closely related species showed that expression of most individual
TFs is not conserved, following the general model of duplication and
diversification. The degree of similarity between TF expression between Xenopus
tropicalis and Danio rerio followed the hourglass model, with the greatest
similarity occuring during the early tailbud stage in Xenopus tropicalis and
the late segmentation stage in Danio rerio. However, for Drosophila
melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae there were two periods of high TF
transcriptome similarity, one during the Arthropod phylotypic stage at 8-10

breaking. This view is supported by an experiment on Compton scattering by the

from the $\sigma$ meson enters into the scattering amplitudes. This experiment
led to a determination of the mass of the $\sigma$ meson of $m_\sigma = 600 \pm

understand stability and complexity in ecological communities. The non-random
structures of real ecological interaction networks has been recognized as one
key ingredient contributing to the coexistence between high complexity and
stability in real ecosystems. However most of the theoretical studies have
considered communities with only one interaction type (either antagonistic,
competitive, or mutualistic). Recently it has been proposed a theoretical
analysis on multiple interaction types in ecological systems, concluding that:
a) Mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions stabilize the system
with respect to the less realistic case of only one interaction type; b)
Complexity, measured in terms of the number of interactions and the number of
species, increases stability in systems with different types of interactions.
By introducing new theoretical investigations and analyzing 21 empirical data
sets representing mutualistic plant-pollinator networks, we show that that
conclusions are incorrect. We will prove that the positive complexity-stability
effect observed in systems with different kind of interactions is a mere
consequence of a rescaling of the interaction strengths, and thus unrelated to
the mixing of interaction types.

minimal mass m_{min} for the WDM particle. The lightest known dwarf galaxy
(Willman I) implies m > m_{min} = 1.91 keV. These results and the observed halo
radius and mass of the compact galaxies provide further indication that the WDM
particle mass m is approximately around 2 keV.

financial time series in a rolling window framework. In particular, we focus on
the detection of episodes of statistically significant two- and three-point
correlations in the returns of several leading currency exchange rates that
could offer some potential for their predictability. We employ a rolling window
approach in order to capture the correlation dynamics for different window
lengths and analyze the distributions of periods with statistically significant
correlations. We find that for sufficiently large window lengths these
distributions fit well to power-law behavior. We also measure the
predictability itself by a hit rate, i.e. the rate of consistency between the
signs of the actual returns and their predictions, obtained from a simple
correlation-based predictor. It is found that during these relatively brief
periods the returns are predictable to a certain degree and the predictability
depends on the selection of the window length.

computing. The simulated entanglement protocol is implemented using oblivious
transfer in the simplest case and other many-to-one mappings in more general
cases. For the case where the mapping is of order k, we prove a theorem that
gives us the function of the entangled state. A useful generalization beyond
this research will be the implementation of quantum states with arbitrary
probability amplitude functions.

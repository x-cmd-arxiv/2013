model-specific parameters of mechanistically motivated parametric statistical
models when evaluating likelihoods is difficult. Central to the success of ABC
methods is computationally inexpensive simulation of data sets from the
parametric model of interest. However, when simulating data sets from a model
is so computationally expensive that the posterior distribution of parameters
cannot be adequately sampled by ABC, inference is not straightforward. We
present approximate approximate Bayesian computation"" (AABC), a class of
methods that extends simulation-based inference by ABC to models in which
simulating data is expensive. In AABC, we first simulate a limited number of
data sets that is computationally feasible to simulate from the parametric
model. We use these data sets as fixed background information to inform a
non-mechanistic statistical model that approximates the correct parametric
model and enables efficient simulation of a large number of data sets by
Bayesian resampling methods. We show that under mild assumptions, the posterior
distribution obtained by AABC converges to the posterior distribution obtained
by ABC, as the number of data sets simulated from the parametric model and the
sample size of the observed data set increase simultaneously. We illustrate the
performance of AABC on a population-genetic model of natural selection, as well

The spectra show vibrational absorption features of simple molecules CH4, CO,
and N2 condensed as ices on Pluto's surface. These absorptions are modulated by
the planet's 6.39 day rotation period, enabling us to constrain the
longitudinal distributions of the three ices. Absorptions of CO and N2 are
concentrated on Pluto's anti-Charon hemisphere, unlike absorptions of less
volatile CH4 ice that are offset by roughly 90{\deg} from the longitude of
maximum CO and N2 absorption. In addition to the diurnal variations, the
spectra show longer term trends. On decadal timescales, Pluto's stronger CH4
absorption bands have been getting deeper, while the amplitude of their diurnal
variation is diminishing, consistent with additional CH4 absorption at high
northern latitudes rotating into view as the sub-Earth latitude moves north (as
defined by the system's angular momentum vector). Unlike the CH4 absorptions,
Pluto's CO and N2 absorptions appear to be declining over time, suggesting more
equatorial or southerly distributions of those species. Comparisons of
geometrically-matched pairs of observations favor geometric explanations for
the observed secular changes in CO and N2 absorption, although seasonal
volatile transport could be at least partly responsible. The case for a
volatile transport contribution to the secular evolution looks strongest for
CH4 ice, despite it being the least volatile of the three ices.

as part of the Carnegie Supernova Project. This data set constitutes the
earliest time-series NIR spectroscopy of a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), with the
first spectrum obtained at 2.58 days past the explosion and covering -14.6 to
+17.3 days relative to B-band maximum. C I {\lambda}1.0693 {\mu}m is detected
in SN 2011fe with increasing strength up to maximum light. The delay in the
onset of the NIR C I line demonstrates its potential to be an effective tracer
of unprocessed material. For the first time in a SN Ia, the early rapid decline
of the Mg II {\lambda}1.0927 {\mu}m velocity was observed, and the subsequent
velocity is remarkably constant. The Mg II velocity during this constant phase
locates the inner edge of carbon burning and probes the conditions under which
the transition from deflagration to detonation occurs. We show that the Mg II
velocity does not correlate with the optical light-curve decline rate
{\Delta}m15. The prominent break at ~1.5 {\mu}m is the main source of concern
for NIR k-correction calculations. We demonstrate here that the feature has a
uniform time evolution among SNe Ia, with the flux ratio across the break
strongly correlated with {\Delta}m15. The predictability of the strength and
the onset of this feature suggests that the associated k-correction
uncertainties can be minimized with improved spectral templates.

quantitative description of levels of organization of complex systems. The need
for such a measure is increasingly necessary in all disciplines studying
complex systems. To address this problem, starting from the most fundamental
principle in Physics, here a new measure for quantity of organization and rate
of self-organization in complex systems based on the principle of least
(stationary) action is applied to a model system - the central processing unit
(CPU) of computers. The quantity of organization for several generations of
CPUs shows a double exponential rate of change of organization with time. The
exact functional dependence has a fine, S-shaped structure, revealing some of
the mechanisms of self-organization. The principle of least action helps to
explain the mechanism of increase of organization through quantity accumulation
and constraint and curvature minimization with an attractor, the least average
sum of actions of all elements and for all motions. This approach can help
describe, quantify, measure, manage, design and predict future behavior of
complex systems to achieve the highest rates of self organization to improve
their quality. It can be applied to other complex systems from Physics,
Chemistry, Biology, Ecology, Economics, Cities, network theory and others where
complex systems are present.

obliquity of the star to be \lambda=19+/-15 degrees by modeling the
Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect in Keck/HIRES radial velocities (RVs). The
anomalous RV time series shows an asymmetry relative to the midtransit time,
ordinarily suggesting a nonzero obliquity -- but in this case at least part of
the asymmetry may be due to the convective blueshift, increasing the
uncertainty in the determination of \lambda. We employ the semi-analytical
approach of Hirano et al. (2011) that includes the effects of macroturbulence,
instrumental broadening, and convective blueshift to accurately model the
anomaly in the net RV caused by the planet eclipsing part of the rotating star.
Obliquity measurements are an important tool for testing theories of planet
formation and migration. To date, the measured obliquities of ~50 Jovian
planets span the full range, from prograde to retrograde, with planets orbiting
cool stars preferentially showing alignment of stellar spins and planetary
orbits. Our results are consistent with this pattern emerging from tidal
interactions in the convective envelopes of cool stars and close-in planets. In
addition, our 1.8 years of new RVs for this system show that the orbit of the
outer planet is more poorly constrained than previously thought, with an
orbital period now in the range of 10-36 years.

the transition to an ordered state on increasing the particle density, as

accompanied by the onset of algebraic behaviour of the two-point velocity

attracted considerable attention for such problems. For large random
transforms, these methods exhibit fast convergence and admit precise analytic
characterizations with testable conditions for optimality, even for certain

techniques. This analysis enables a precise characterization of the GAMP

show that the fixed points of the so-called max-sum GAMP algorithm for MAP
estimation are critical points of a constrained maximization of the posterior

the posterior marginals can be interpreted as critical points of a certain free

present a somewhat simpler proof of this fact, and demonstrate its utility by
isolating a key property of the linear transformations $(x,y) -> (x+y,x),
(x,y+x)$ that yields expansion.
  As an example, consider any invertible, integral matrix $S \in GL_2(Z)$ and

speculative \emph{transactions} that can either \emph{commit} or \emph{abort}.
If a transaction commits, it appears to be executed sequentially, so that the
committed transactions constitute a correct sequential execution. If a
transaction aborts, none of its instructions can affect other transactions.
  The popular criterion of \emph{opacity} requires that the views of aborted
transactions must also be consistent with the global sequential order
constituted by committed ones. This is believed to be important, since
inconsistencies observed by an aborted transaction may cause a fatal
irrecoverable error or waste of the system in an infinite loop. Intuitively, an
opaque implementation must ensure that no intermediate view a transaction
obtains before it commits or aborts can be affected by a transaction that has
not started committing yet, so called \emph{deferred-update} semantics.
  In this paper, we intend to grasp this intuition formally. We propose a
variant of opacity that explicitly requires the sequential order to respect the
deferred-update semantics. We show that our criterion is a safety property,
i.e., it is prefix- and limit-closed. Unlike opacity, our property also ensures
that a serialization of a history implies serializations of its prefixes.
Finally, we show that our property is equivalent to opacity if we assume that
no two transactions commit identical values on the same variable, and present a
counter-example for scenarios when the ""unique-write"" assumption does not hold.

problems of the probability distribution for a passive scalar in isotropic

Prelle-Singer procedure to turbulence models. The following key questions are
discussed and solved: what is the general dynamical structure of the resulting
scale equation permitted by passive scalar turbulence models? What are the
general requirements of the relations between canonical variables and the
canonical variabes representation for turbulence by using canonical variables?
It is shown that the existence of the Haniltonian representation in turbulence
is a privilege of only turbulence systems for which the variational principle
of least action is impossible The master equation of the probability

  Networks",,,"10.1109/TSP.2014.2320458",,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recently proposed sequential distributed detector based on
level-triggered sampling operates as simple as the decision fusion techniques
and at the same time performs as well as the data fusion techniques. Hence, it
is well suited for resource-constrained wireless sensor networks. However, in
practical cases where sensors observe discrete-time signals, the random
overshoot above or below the sampling thresholds considerably degrades the
performance of the considered detector. We propose, for systems with stringent
energy constraints, a novel approach to tackle this problem by encoding the
overshoot into the time delay between the sampling time and the transmission
time. Specifically, each sensor computes the local log-likelihood ratio (LLR)
and samples it using level-triggered sampling. Then, it transmits a single
pulse to the fusion center (FC) after a transmission delay that is proportional
to the overshoot, as in pulse position modulation (PPM). The FC, upon receiving
a bit decodes the corresponding overshoot and recovers the transmitted LLR
value. It then updates the approximate global LLR and compares it with two
threshold to either make a decision or to continue the sequential process. We
analyze the asymptotic average detection delay performance of the proposed
scheme. We then apply the proposed sequential scheme to target detection in
wireless sensor networks under the four Swerling fluctuating target models. It
is seen that the proposed sequential distributed detector offers significant
performance advantage over conventional decision fusion techniques.

functions subject to linear linking constraints. The classical alternating
direction type methods usually assume that the two convex functions have
relatively easy proximal mappings. However, many problems arising from
statistics, image processing and other fields have the structure that while one
of the two functions has easy proximal mapping, the other function is smoothly
convex but does not have an easy proximal mapping. Therefore, the classical
alternating direction methods cannot be applied. To deal with the difficulty,
we propose in this paper an alternating direction method based on
extragradients. Under the assumption that the smooth function has a Lipschitz
continuous gradient, we prove that the proposed method returns an
$\epsilon$-optimal solution within $O(1/\epsilon)$ iterations. We apply the
proposed method to solve a new statistical model called fused logistic
regression. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed method performs
very well when solving the test problems. We also test the performance of the
proposed method through solving the lasso problem arising from statistics and
compare the result with several existing efficient solvers for this problem;
the results are very encouraging indeed.

spreads in a network, how to root out this rumor source? With the a priori
knowledge of suspect nodes and an observation of infected nodes, we construct a
maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to identify the rumor source using the
susceptible-infected (SI) model. The a priori suspect set and its associated
connectivity bring about new ingredients to the problem, and thus we propose to
use local rumor center, a generalized concept based on rumor centrality, to
identify the source from suspects. For regular tree-type networks of node
degree {\delta}, we characterize Pc(n), the correct detection probability of
the estimator upon observing n infected nodes, in both the finite and
asymptotic regimes. First, when every infected node is a suspect, Pc(n)
asymptotically grows from 0.25 to 0.307 with {\delta} from 3 to infinity, a
result first established in Shah and Zaman (2011, 2012) via a different
approach; and it monotonically decreases with n and increases with {\delta}.
Second, when the suspects form a connected subgraph of the network, Pc(n)
asymptotically significantly exceeds the a priori probability if {\delta}>2,
and reliable detection is achieved as {\delta} becomes large; furthermore, it
monotonically decreases with n and increases with {\delta}. Third, when there
are only two suspects, Pc(n) is asymptotically at least 0.75 if {\delta}>2; and
it increases with the distance between the two suspects. Fourth, when there are
multiple suspects, among all possible connection patterns, that they form a
connected subgraph of the network achieves the smallest detection probability.
Our analysis leverages ideas from the Polya's urn model in probability theory
and sheds insight into the behavior of the rumor spreading process not only in
the asymptotic regime but also for the general finite-n regime.

renormalization transformations in statistical mechanics. In particular, it
compares two methods of transformation: the ""potential-moving"" approach most
used in the period 1975-1980 and the ""rewiring method"" as it has been developed
in the last five years. These methods both employ a parameter, called \chi,
that measures the complexity of the localized stochastic variable forming the
basis of the analysis. Both methods are here exemplified by calculations in
terms of fixed points for the smallest possible values of \chi. These
calculations describe three models for two-dimensional systems: The Ising model
solved by Onsager, the tricritical point of that model, and the three-state
Potts model. The older method, often described as lower bound renormalization
theory, provides a heuristic method giving reasonably accurate results for
critical indices at the lowest degree of complexity, i.e. \chi=2. In contrast,
the rewiring method, employing ""singular value decomposition"", does not perform
as well for low \chi values but offers an error that apparently decreases
slowly toward zero as \chi is increased. It appears likely that no such
improvement occurs in the older approach.
  A detailed comparison of the two methods is performed, with a particular eye
to describing the reasons why they are so different. For example, the old
method quite naturally employed fixed points for its analysis; these are hard
to use in the newer approach. A discussion is given of why the fixed point
approach proves to be hard in this context.
  In the new approach the calculated the thermal critical indices are
satisfactory for the smallest values of \chi but hardly improve as \chi is
increased, while the magnetic critical indices do not agree well with the known
theoretical values.

finitely generated fields of odd characteristic to a version of the Tate
conjecture for certain endomorphisms on the attached Kuga-Satake abelian
variety, which we prove. As a by-product of our methods, we also show that the
moduli stack of primitively polarized K3 surfaces of degree 2d is
quasi-projective and, when d is not divisible by p^2, is geometrically
irreducible in characteristic p. We indicate how the same method applies to
prove the Tate conjecture for co-dimension 2 cycles on cubic fourfolds.

weather and terrestrial markets of agricultural products. It is shown that to
implement the possible effect of space weather on the terrestrial harvests and
prices, a simultaneous fulfillment of three conditions is required: 1)
sensitivity of local weather (cloud cover, atmospheric circulation) to the
state of space weather; 2) sensitivity of the area of specific agricultural
crops to the weather anomalies (belonging to the area of risk farming); 3)
relative isolation of the market, making it difficult to damp the price hikes
by the external food supplies. Four possible scenarios of the market response
to the modulations of local terrestrial weather via the solar activity are
described. The data sources and analysis methods applied to detect this
relationship are characterized. We describe the behavior of 22 European markets
during the medieval period, in particular, during the Maunder minimum
(1650-1715). We demonstrate a reliable manifestation of the influence of space
weather on prices, discovered in the statistics of intervals between the price
hikes and phase price asymmetry. We show that the effects of phase price
asymmetry persist even during the early modern period in the U.S. in the
production of the durum wheat. Within the proposed approach, we analyze the
statistics of depopulation in the eighteenth and nineteenth century Iceland,
induced by the famine due to a sharp livestock reduction owing to, in its turn,
the lack of foodstuff due to the local weather anomalies. A high statistical
significance of temporal matching of these events with the periods of extreme
solar activity is demonstrated. We discuss the possible consequences of the

tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the inflation expansion index $\beta$ for the
fixed scalar spectral index $n_s$. Even though, the spectrum of RGWs in low
frequencies is hardly depends on any parameters, the high frequency parts will
be affected by several parameters, such as $n_s$, the reheating temperature
$T_{RH}$ and the index $\beta_s$ describing the expansion from the end of
inflation to the reheating process. We analyzed in detail all the factors which
would affect the spectrum of RGWs in high frequencies including the quantum
normalization. We found that the future GW detectors SKA, eLISA, BBO and DECIGO
are promising to catch the signals of RGWs.
  Furthermore, BBO and DECIGO have the potential not only to distinguish the

of considerable interest since the discovery of superconductivity in CePt_3Si.
In noncentrosymmetric materials, the degeneracy of bands is lifted in the
presence of spin-orbit coupling. This will bring about new effects in the Kondo
effect since the band degeneracy plays an important role in the scattering of
electrons by localized spins. We investigate the single-impurity Kondo problem
in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We examine the effect of spin-orbit
coupling on the scattering of conduction electrons, by using the Green's
function method, for the s-d Hamiltonian, with employing a decoupling
procedure. As a result, we obtain a closed system of equations of Green's
functions, from which we can calculate physical quantities. The Kondo
temperature T_K is estimated from a singularity of Green's functions. We show
that T_K is reduced as the spin-orbit coupling constant \alpha is increased.
When 2\alpha k_F is comparable to or greater than k_BT_K(\alpha=0), T_K shows
an abrupt decrease as a result of the band splitting. This suggests a Kondo
collapse accompanied with a sharp decrease of T_K. The log T-dependence of the
resistivity will be concealed by the spin-orbit interaction.

altered by the stratification. Stratification-induced inhomogeneity ""turns on""
the buoyancy introducing a new ""cutoff"" or ""screening"" length scale for the

Turbulence mixes the density opposing the effect. Here we derive and solve the
advection-diffusion equation that describes the interplay of turbulent mixing,
diffusion of the stratifying agent and buoyancy. We derive an exact expression
for fluctuations due to weak background turbulence and show that stronger
turbulence can completely change the flow around the particle, canceling the
effect of stratification and restoring the unstratified Stokes flow.

potential applications in optoelectronics and because they carry the
possibility of exhibiting large magnetic moments for spintronic applications.
Due to their similarities to metastable zinc blende half-metals, the
half-Heusler alloys $\beta$-LiMnZ (Z = N, P and Si) were systematically
examined for their electric, magnetic and stability properties at optimized
lattice constants and strained lattice constants that exhibit half-metallic
properties. Other phases of the half-Heusler structure ($\alpha$ and $\gamma$)
are also reported here, but they are unlikely to be grown. The magnetic moments
of these stable Li-based alloys are expected to reach as high as 4
$\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ per unit cell when Z = Si and 5 $\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ per unit
cell when Z = N and P, however the antiferromagnetic spin configuration is
energetically favored when Z is a pnictogen. $\beta$-LiMnSi at a lattice
constant 14\% larger than its equilibrium lattice constant is a promising
half-metal for spintronic applications due to its large magnetic moment and
vibrational stability. The modified Slater--Pauling rule for these alloys is
determined. Finally, a plausible method for developing half-metallic Li$_x$MnZ
at equilibrium, by tuning $x$, is investigated, but, unlike tetragonalization,
this type of alloying introduces local structural changes that destroy the
half-metallicity.

non-equilibrium physics based on our previously published work. First we
explain why a theory of quantum gravity and non-equilibrium statistical physics
should be related in the first place. Then we present the necessary background
from the recent research in non-equilibrium physics. The review discusses the
relationship of string theory and aging phenomena, as well as the connection
between AdS/CFT correspondence and the Jarzynski identity. We also discuss the
emergent symmetries in fully developed turbulence and the corresponding
non-equilibrium stationary states. Finally we outline a larger picture
regarding the relationship between non-perturbative quantum gravity and
non-equilibrium statistical physics. This relationship can be understood as a
natural generalization of the well-known Wilsonian relation between local
quantum field theory and equilibrium statistical physics of critical phenomena.
According to this picture the AdS/CFT duality is just an example of a more
general connection between non-perturbative quantum gravity and non-equilibrium
physics. In the appendix of this review we discuss a new kind of
complementarity between thermodynamics and statistical physics which should be
important in the context of black hole complementarity.

article presents a solitaire challenge: extract an order 7 affine plane and
arrange those 49 cards into a square such that the symmetries of the affine and
projective planes are obvious. The objective is not to simply create such a
deck already in this solved position. Rather, it is to solve the inverse
problem of arranging the cards of such a deck which has already been created
shuffled.

strictly hold in a distributed system of which the different parts are at a
finite distance from each other. This is due to the finite speed of signal
propagation which cannot exceed the speed of light at vacuum, which in turn
means that when summing the total force in the system the force does not add up
to zero. This was demonstrated in a specific example of two current loops with
time dependent currents, the above analysis led to suggestion of a relativistic
engine \cite{MTAY3,AY1}. Since the system is effected by a total force for a
finite period of time this means that the system acquires mechanical momentum
and energy, the question then arises if we need to abandon the law of momentum
and energy conservation. The subject of momentum conversation was discussed in
\cite{MTAY4}. Here some preliminary aspects of the exchange of energy between
the mechanical part of the relativistic engine and the electromagnetic field
are discussed. We also refer briefly to the material composition, structure and
properties of metals that should be used in a relativistic engine.

we study topological quantum pumping in a strongly interacting system. The
system under consideration is described by the Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional
extended Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of a correlated hopping which
breaks lattice inversion symmetry. This model has been predicted to support
topological pumping [E. Berg, M. Levin, and E. Altman, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106,
110405 (2011)]. The pumped charge is quantized and of topological nature. We
provide a detailed analysis of the finite-size-scaling behavior of the pumped
charge and its deviations from the quantized value. Furthermore we also analyze
the non-adiabatic corrections due to the finite frequency of the modulation. We
consider two configurations: a closed ring where the time-dependence of the
parameter induces a circulating current, and a finite open-ended chain where
particles are dragged from one edge to the opposite edge, due to the pumping
mechanism induced by the bulk.

high-energy processes of young stellar objects (YSOs). The observed thermal
X-ray emission can be accompanied by both thermal and nonthermal radio
emission. Due to variability, simultaneous X-ray and radio observations are a
priori required, but results have been inconclusive. Aims: We use archival
X-ray and radio observations of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) to significantly
enlarge the sample size of known YSOs with both X-ray and radio detections.
Methods: We study the ONC using multi-epoch non-simultaneous archival Chandra
X-ray and NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) single-band radio data. The multiple
epochs allow us to reduce the impact of variability by obtaining approximated
quiescent fluxes. Results: We find that only a small fraction of the X-ray
sources (7%) have radio counterparts, even if 60% of the radio sources have
X-ray counterparts. The radio flux density is typically too low to distinguish
thermal and nonthermal radio sources. Only a small fraction of the YSOs with
detections in both bands are compatible with the empirical ""Guedel-Benz"" (GB)
relation. Most of the sources not compatible with the GB relation are proplyds,
and thus likely thermal sources, but only a fraction of the proplyds is
detected in both bands, such that the role of these sources is inconclusive.
Conclusions: While the radio sources appear to be globally unrelated to the
X-ray sources, the X-ray dataset clearly is much more sensitive than the radio
data. We find tentative evidence that known non-thermal radio sources and
saturated X-ray sources are indeed close to the empirical relation, even if
skewed to higher radio luminosities, as they are expected to be. Most of the
sources that are clearly incompatible with the empirical relation are proplyds
which could instead plausibly be thermal radio sources.

We present the first study to investigate the response of the Jovian

azimuthally symmetric global circulation model coupled to a simple
magnetosphere and fixed auroral conductivity model. In our simulations, the
Jovian magnetosphere encounters a solar wind shock or rarefaction region and is
subsequently compressed or expanded. We present the ensuing response of the
coupling currents, thermospheric flows, heating and cooling terms, and the
aurora to these transient events. Transient compressions cause the reversal,
with respect to steady state, of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents and
momentum transfer between the thermosphere and magnetosphere. They also cause
at least a factor of two increase in the Joule heating rate. Ion drag
significantly changes the kinetic energy of the thermospheric neutrals
depending on whether the magnetosphere is compressed or expanded. Local
temperature variations appear between ~ -45 and 175 K for the compression
scenario and ~ -20 and 50 K for the expansion case. Extended regions of
equatorward flow develop in the wake of compression events - we discuss the
implications of this behaviour for global energy transport. Both compressions
and expansions lead to a ~ 2000 TW increase in the total power dissipated or
deposited in the thermosphere. In terms of auroral processes, transient
compressions increase main oval UV emission by a factor of 4.5 whilst transient
expansions increase this main emission by a more modest 37%. Both types of
transient event cause shifts in the position of the main oval, of up to 1 deg

the electric charge balance function in the relative pseudorapidity
($\Delta\eta$) and azimuthal angle ($\Delta\varphi$) in Pb--Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron
Collider. The width of the balance function decreases with growing centrality
(i.e. for more central collisions) in both projections. This centrality
dependence is not reproduced by HIJING, while AMPT, a model which incorporates
strings and parton rescattering, exhibits qualitative agreement with the
measured correlations in $\Delta\varphi$ but fails to describe the correlations
in $\Delta\eta$. A thermal blast-wave model incorporating local charge
conservation and tuned to describe the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra and v$_2$
measurements reported by ALICE, is used to fit the centrality dependence of the
width of the balance function and to extract the average separation of
balancing charges at freeze-out. The comparison of our results with
measurements at lower energies reveals an ordering with $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$:
the balance functions become narrower with increasing energy for all
centralities. This is consistent with the effect of larger radial flow at the
LHC energies but also with the late stage creation scenario of balancing
charges. However, the relative decrease of the balance function widths in
$\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\varphi$ with centrality from the highest SPS to the
LHC energy exhibits only small differences. This observation cannot be
interpreted solely within the framework where the majority of the charge is
produced at a later stage in the evolution of the heavy--ion collision.

first-principle calculations of the bandstructure and of the density of states
projected on the different bands, we show that this trend, as well as the Tc

within an effective three-band Eliashberg model as being due to a suppression
of the superfluid density at finite temperature that, in turns, modifies the
temperature dependence of the characteristic spin-fluctuation energy.

robots---cooperative localization---is a core problem in contemporary robotics.
Current works focus on a set of mutually observable world landmarks and often
require inbuilt egomotion estimates; situations in which both assumptions are
violated often arise, for example, robots with erroneous low quality odometry
and IMU exploring an unknown environment. In contrast to these existing works
in cooperative localization, we propose a cooperative localization method,
which we call mutual localization, that uses reciprocal observations of
camera-fiducials to obviate the need for egomotion estimates and mutually
observable world landmarks. We formulate and solve an algebraic formulation for
the pose of the two camera mutual localization setup under these assumptions.
Our experiments demonstrate the capabilities of our proposal egomotion-free
cooperative localization method: for example, the method achieves 2cm range and
0.7 degree accuracy at 2m sensing for 6-DOF pose. To demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed work, we deploy our method on Turtlebots and we
compare our results with ARToolKit and Bundler, over which our method achieves
a 10 fold improvement in translation estimation accuracy.

new transit light curves of WASP-10b obtained with the Faulkes Telescope North

published ones, were modelled with a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo transit fitting
code. (...)
  Our homogeneously derived transit times do not support the previous claimed
TTV signal, which was strongly dependent on 2 previously published transits
that have been incorrectly normalised. Nevertheless, a linear ephemeris is not
a statistically good fit to the transit times of WASP-10b. We show that the
observed transit time variations are due to spot occultation features or
systematics. We discuss and exemplify the effects of occultation spot features
in the measured transit times and show that despite spot occultation during
egress and ingress being difficult to distinguish in the transit light curves,
they have a significant effect in the measured transit times. We conclude that
if we account for spot features, the transit times of WASP-10 are consistent
with a linear ephemeris with the exception of one transit (epoch 143) which is
a partial transit. Therefore, there is currently no evidence for the existence
of a companion to WASP-10b. Our results support the lack of TTVs of

we map out the ground state phase diagram as a function of mass ratio M/m and
interaction strength. In particular, we determine when it is favorable for the
dressed impurity (polaron) to bind particles from the Fermi sea to form a
dimer, trimer or even larger clusters. Similarly to 3D, we find that the Fermi
sea favors the trimer state so that it exists for M/m less than the critical
mass ratio for trimer formation in the vacuum. We also find a region where
dimers have finite momentum in the ground state, a scenario which corresponds
to the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superfluid state in the limit of large
spin imbalance. For equal masses (M=m), we compute rigorous bounds on the
polaron-dimer transition, and we show that the polaron energy and residue is
well captured by the variational approach, with the former quantity being in
good agreement with experiment. When there is a finite density of impurities,

superfluid-normal transition at zero temperature, but it remains an open

a recurrent encoder of rectified linear units, unrolled for a fixed number of

predict its supervised classification. Training via
backpropagation-through-time initially minimizes an unsupervised sparse

term on the supervised classification. The depth implicit in the
temporally-unrolled form allows the system to exhibit all the power of deep

  From an initially unstructured network the hidden units differentiate into
categorical-units, each of which represents an input prototype with a
well-defined class; and part-units representing deformations of these
prototypes. The learned organization of the recurrent encoder is hierarchical:
part-units are driven directly by the input, whereas the activity of
categorical-units builds up over time through interactions with the part-units.
Even using a small number of hidden units per layer, discriminative recurrent

apparent horizon of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe, one can derive the
corresponding Friedmann equations in Einstein, Gauss-Bonnet, and more general
Lovelock gravity. Is this a generic feature of any gravitational theory? Is the
prescription applicable to other gravities? In this paper we would like to
address the above questions by examining the same procedure for Horava-Lifshitz
gravity. We find that in Horava-Lifshitz gravity, this approach does not work
and we fail to reproduce a corresponding Friedmann equation in this theory by
applying the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon, together with
the appropriate expression for the entropy in Horava-Lifshitz gravity. The
reason for this failure seems to be due to the fact that Horava-Lifshitz
gravity is not diffeomorphism invariant, and thus, the corresponding field
equation cannot be derived from the first law around horizon in the spacetime.
Without this, it implies that the specific gravitational theory is not
consistent, which shows an additional problematic feature of Horrava-Lifshitz
gravity. Nevertheless, if we still take the area formula of geometric entropy
and regard Horava-Lifshitz sector in the Friedmann equation as an effective
dark radiation, we are able to extract the corresponding Friedmann equation
from the first law of thermodynamics.

a deflection in the arrival direction of the observed photons (also known as
CMB aberration) and a Doppler shift in the measured photon frequencies. As a
consequence, aberration and Doppler effects induce non trivial correlations
between the harmonic coefficients of the observed CMB temperature maps. In this
paper we investigate whether these correlations generate a bias on
Non-Gaussianity estimators $f_{NL}$. We perform this analysis simulating a
large number of temperature maps with Planck-like resolution (lmax $= 2000$) as
different realizations of the same cosmological fiducial model (WMAP7yr). We
then add to these maps aberration and Doppler effects employing a modified
version of the HEALPix code. We finally evaluate a generalization of the
Komatsu, Spergel and Wandelt Non-Gaussianity estimator for all the simulated
maps, both when peculiar velocity effects have been considered and when these
phenomena have been neglected. Using the value $v/c=1.23 \times 10^{-3}$ for
our peculiar velocity, we found that the aberration/Doppler induced
Non-Gaussian signal is at most of about half of the cosmic variance $\sigma$
for $f_{NL}$ both in a full-sky and in a cut-sky experimental configuration,
for local, equilateral and orthogonal estimators. We conclude therefore that
when estimating $f_{NL}$ it is safe to ignore aberration and Doppler effects
{\it if} the primordial map is already Gaussian. More work is necessary however
to assess whether a map which contains Non-Gaussianity can be significantly
distorted by a peculiar velocity.

particle positions, without requiring any type of smoothing or analysis grid,
thereby providing high sensitivity to all non-linear structures resolved by the
simulations. In order to identify the detailed origin of the shape of the
one-point density probability distribution function (PDF), we decompose the
simulation particles according to the mass of their host FoF halos, and examine
the contributions of different halo mass ranges to the global density PDF. We
model the one-point distribution of the FoF halos in each halo mass bin with a
set of Monte Carlo realizations of idealized NFW dark matter halos, finding
that this reproduces the measurements from the N-body simulations reasonably
well, except for a small excess present in simulation results. This excess
increases with increasing halo mass. We show that its origin lies in
substructure, which becomes progressively more abundant and better resolved in
more massive dark matter halos. We demonstrate that the high density tail of
the one-point distribution function in less massive halos is severely affected
by the gravitational softening length and the mass resolution. In particular,
we find these two parameters to be more important for an accurate measurement
of the density PDF than the simulated volume. Combining our results from
individual halo mass bins we find that the part of the one-point density PDF
originating from collapsed halos can nevertheless be quite well described by a
simple superposition of a set of NFW halos with the expected cosmological
abundance over the resolved mass range. The transition region to the
low-density unbound material is however not well captured by such an analytic
halo model.

standard design choice and their high repair cost is often considered an
unavoidable price to pay for high storage efficiency and high reliability.
  This paper shows how to overcome this limitation. We present a novel family
of erasure codes that are efficiently repairable and offer higher reliability
compared to Reed-Solomon codes. We show analytically that our codes are optimal
on a recently identified tradeoff between locality and minimum distance.
  We implement our new codes in Hadoop HDFS and compare to a currently deployed
HDFS module that uses Reed-Solomon codes. Our modified HDFS implementation
shows a reduction of approximately 2x on the repair disk I/O and repair network
traffic. The disadvantage of the new coding scheme is that it requires 14% more
storage compared to Reed-Solomon codes, an overhead shown to be information
theoretically optimal to obtain locality. Because the new codes repair failures
faster, this provides higher reliability, which is orders of magnitude higher

in a strongly coupled CFT. The non-equilibrium initial state is created by
switching on a relevant perturbation in the CFT vacuum during Delta t >= t >=
-Delta t. Via AdS/CFT, the thermalization process corresponds to the
gravitational collapse of a tachyonic scalar field (m^2 = -3) in the Poincare
patch of AdS_5. In the limit Delta t < 0.02/T, the thermalization time t_T is
found to be quantitatively the same as that of a non-equilibrium state created
by a marginal perturbation discussed in Ref. [5]. In the case Delta t >= 1/T,
we also obtain double-collapse solutions but with a non-equilibrium
intermediate state at t = 0. In all the cases our results show that the system
thermalizes in a typical time t_T ~ O(1)/T. Besides, a conserved energy-moment
current in the bulk is found, which helps understand the qualitative difference
of the collapse process in the Poincare patch from that in global AdS[9, 10].

count rate of the Alice ultraviolet spectrograph. Electrons with energies >1
MeV can penetrate the thin aluminum housing of Alice, interact with the
microchannel plate detector, and produce a count that is indistinguishable from
an FUV photon. We present Alice data, proportional to the MeV electron flux,
from an 11-day period centered on the spacecraft's closest approach to Jupiter,
and compare it to electron data from the PEPSSI instrument. We find that a
solar wind compression event passed over the spacecraft just prior to it
entering the Jovian magnetosphere. Subsequently, the magnetopause boundary was
detected at a distance of 67 R_J suggesting a compressed magnetospheric
configuration. Three days later, when the spacecraft was 35-90 R_J downstream
of Jupiter, New Horizons observed a series of 15 current sheet crossings, all
of which occurred significantly northward of model predictions implying solar
wind influence over the middle and outer Jovian magnetosphere, even to radial
distances as small as ~35 R_J. In addition, we find the Jovian current sheet,
which had a half-thickness of at least 7.4 R_J between 1930 and 2100 LT
abruptly thinned to a thickness of ~3.4 R_J around 2200 LT.

(e.g., Newtonian dynamics), such equations are generally numerically integrated
according to a well-developed set of algorithms that share commonly agreed-upon
desirable properties. However, for stochastic equations of motion (e.g.,
Langevin dynamics), there is still broad disagreement over which integration
algorithms are most appropriate. While multiple desiderata have been proposed
throughout the literature, consensus on which criteria are important is absent,
and no published integration scheme satisfies all desiderata simultaneously.
Additional nontrivial complications stem from simulating systems driven out of
equilibrium using existing stochastic integration schemes in conjunction with
recently-developed nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems. Here, we examine a
family of discrete time integration schemes for Langevin dynamics, assessing
how each member satisfies a variety of desiderata that have been enumerated in
prior efforts to construct suitable Langevin integrators. We show that the
incorporation of a novel time step rescaling in the deterministic updates of
position and velocity can correct a number of dynamical defects in these
integrators. Finally, we identify a particular splitting that has essentially
universally appropriate properties for the simulation of Langevin dynamics for
molecular systems in equilibrium, nonequilibrium, and path sampling contexts.

threshold, the addition of noise may lead to energy transmission, provided that

diameter, assuming an R-band albedo of p_R=0.05 and a Mercury-like phase
function. The present-day Vulcanoid population, if it exists at all, is likely
a small remnant of the hypothetical primordial Vulcanoid population due to the
combined effects of collisional evolution and subsequent radiative transport of
collisional fragments. If we assume an extant Vulcanoid population with a

star formation. We have used Herschel data from the HOBYS key program to
produce and analyze column density and temperature maps. Two preliminary
catalogs were produced by extracting sources from the column density map and
from Herschel maps convolved to the 500 micron resolution. Herschel reveals
that among the compact sources (FWHM<0.45 pc), W3 East, W3 West, and W3 (OH)
are the most massive and luminous and have the highest column density.
Considering the unique properties of W3 East and W3 West, the only clumps with
on-going high-mass star formation, we suggest a 'convergent constructive
feedback' scenario to account for the formation of a cluster with decreasing
age and increasing system/source mass toward the innermost regions. This
process, which relies on feedback by high-mass stars to ensure the availability
of material during cluster formation, could also lead to the creation of an
environment suitable for the formation of Trapezium-like systems. In common
with other scenarios proposed in other HOBYS studies, our results indicate that
an active/dynamic process aiding in the accumulation, compression, and
confinement of material is a critical feature of the high-mass star/cluster
formation, distinguishing it from classical low-mass star formation. The
environmental conditions and availability of triggers determine the form in
which this process occurs, implying that high-mass star/cluster formation could
arise from a range of scenarios: from large scale convergence of turbulent
flows, to convergent constructive feedback or mergers of filaments.

to Jupiter, the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVIS) made a radial scan
through the midnight sector of Io plasma torus. The Io torus has not been
previously observed at this local time. The UVIS data consist of 2-D spectrally
dispersed images of the Io plasma torus in the wavelength range of
561{\AA}-1912{\AA}. We developed a spectral emissions model that incorporates
the latest atomic physics data contained in the CHIANTI database in order to
derive the composition of the torus plasma as a function of radial distance.
Electron temperatures derived from the UVIS torus spectra are generally less
than those observed during the Voyager era. We find the torus ion composition
derived from the UVIS spectra to be significantly different from the
composition during the Voyager era. Notably, the torus contains substantially
less oxygen, with a total oxygen-to-sulfur ion ratio of 0.9. The average ion
charge state has increased to 1.7. We detect S V in the Io torus at the
3{\sigma} level. S V has a mixing ratio of 0.5%. The spectral emission model
used in can approximate the effects of a non-thermal distribution of electrons.
The ion composition derived using a kappa distribution of electrons is
identical to that derived using a Maxwellian electron distribution; however,
the kappa distribution model requires a higher electron column density to match
the observed brightness of the spectra. The derived value of the kappa
parameter decreases with radial distance and is consistent with the value of
{\kappa}=2.4 at 8 RJ derived by the Ulysses URAP instrument (Meyer-Vernet et
al., 1995). The observed radial profile of electron column density is
consistent with a flux tube content, NL^2, that is proportional to r^-2.

kernel learning (OKL), we introduce a method that jointly learns multiple
functions and a low-rank multi-task kernel by solving a non-convex
regularization problem. Optimization is carried out via a block coordinate
descent strategy, where each subproblem is solved using suitable conjugate

which requires nearly all of the images taken for the correction. The best way
to make such algorithms the least disruptive to science exposures is to reduce
the number required to estimate the field. We demonstrate a Kalman filter
estimator that uses prior knowledge to create the estimate of the electric

image plane electric field while stabilizing the suppression against poor
signal-to-noise (SNR). In addition to a significant reduction in exposures, we
discuss the relative merit of this algorithm to estimation schemes that do not
incorporate prior state estimate history, particularly in regard to estimate
error and covariance. Ultimately the filter will lead to an adaptive algorithm
which can estimate physical parameters in the laboratory for robustness to

galactic discs, consistently connecting the galaxy-averaged star formation law
with star formation proceeding in giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Our focus is
on galaxies with gas surface density Sigma_g>~100 Msun pc^-2. In our theory,
the galactic disc consists of Toomre-mass GMCs embedded in a volume-filling
ISM. Radiation pressure on dust disperses GMCs and most supernovae explode in
the volume-filling medium. A galaxy-averaged star formation law is derived by
balancing the momentum input from supernova feedback with the gravitational
weight of the disc gas. This star formation law is in good agreement with
observations for a CO conversion factor depending continuously on Sigma_g. We
argue that the galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency per free fall time,
epsilon_ff^gal, is only a weak function of the efficiency with which GMCs
convert their gas into stars. This is possible because the rate limiting step
for star formation is the rate at which GMCs form: for large efficiency of star
formation in GMCs, the Toomre Q parameter obtains a value slightly above unity
so that the GMC formation rate is consistent with the galaxy-averaged star
formation law. We contrast our results with other theories of
turbulence-regulated star formation and discuss predictions of our model. Using
a compilation of data from the literature, we show that the galaxy-averaged
star formation efficiency per free fall time is non-universal and increases
with increasing gas fraction, as predicted by our model. We also predict that
the fraction of the disc gas mass in bound GMCs decreases for increasing values
of the GMC star formation efficiency. This is qualitatively consistent with the
smooth molecular gas distribution inferred in local ultra-luminous infrared
galaxies and the small mass fraction in giant clumps in high-redshift galaxies.

accuracy of direct-summation N-body methods with a statistical description for
the planetesimal disc based on Fokker-Planck techniques. We then address the
formation of planets, with a focus on the formation of protoplanets out of
planetesimals. We find that the evolution of the system is driven by encounters
as well as direct collisions and requires a careful modelling of the evolution
of the velocity dispersion and the size distribution over a large range of
sizes. The simulations show no termination of the protoplanetary accretion due
to gap formation, since the distribution of the planetesimals is only subjected
to small fluctuations. We also show that these features are weakly correlated
with the positions of the protoplanets. The exploration of different impact
strengths indicates that fragmentation mainly controls the overall mass loss,
which is less pronounced during the early runaway growth. We prove that the
fragmentation in combination with the effective removal of collisional
fragments by gas drag sets an universal upper limit of the protoplanetary mass

both the Milky Way and the Local Group. These streams have been tidally torn
from orbiting systems, which suggests that most of them should roughly trace
the orbit of their progenitors around the Galaxy. As a consequence, they play a
fundamental role in understanding the formation and evolution of our Galaxy.
This project is based on the possibility of applying a technique developed by
Binney in 2008 to various tidal streams and overdensities in the Galaxy. The
aim is to develop an efficient method to constrain the Galactic gravitational
potential, to determine its mass distribution, and to test distance
measurements. Here we apply the technique to the Grillmair & Dionatos cold
stellar stream. In the case of noise-free data, the results show that the
technique provides excellent discrimination against incorrect potentials and
that it is possible to predict the heliocentric distance very accurately. This
changes dramatically when errors are taken into account, which wash out most of

days and one week after the burst, thanks to the afterglow remaining unusually
bright at late times. Apart from a wealth of metal resonance lines, we also
detect lines arising from fine-structure levels of the ground state of Fe II,
and from metastable levels of Fe II and Ni II at the host redshift (z =
1.4084). These lines are found to vary significantly in time. The combination
of the data and modelling results shows that we detect the fall of the Ni II 4
F9/2 metastable level population, which to date has not been observed. Assuming
that the population of the excited states is due to the UV-radiation of the
afterglow, we estimate an absorber distance of a few hundred pc. This appears
to be a typical value when compared to similar studies. We detect two
intervening absorbers (z = 1.3147, 1.3179). Despite the wide temporal range of

Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and three brown dwarfs with extremely red
near-infrared colors that exhibit characteristics of both L and T dwarfs. Two
of the new T dwarfs are likely binaries with L7+/-1 primaries and mid-type T
secondaries. In addition, our follow-up program has confirmed 10 previously
identified T dwarfs and four photometrically-selected L and T dwarf candidates
in the literature. This sample, along with the previous WISE discoveries,
triples the number of known brown dwarfs with spectral types later than T5.
Using the WISE All-Sky Source Catalog we present updated color-color and
color-type diagrams for all the WISE-discovered T and Y dwarfs. Near-infrared
spectra of the new discoveries are presented, along with spectral
classifications. To accommodate later T dwarfs we have modified the integrated
flux method of determining spectral indices to instead use the median flux.
Furthermore, a newly defined J-narrow index differentiates the early-type Y
dwarfs from late-type T dwarfs based on the J-band continuum slope. The K/J
indices for this expanded sample show that 32% of late-type T dwarfs have
suppressed K-band flux and are blue relative to the spectral standards, while
only 11% are redder than the standards. Comparison of the Y/J and K/J index to
models suggests diverse atmospheric conditions and supports the possible
re-emergence of clouds after the L/T transition. We also discuss peculiar brown
dwarfs and candidates that were found not to be substellar, including two Young
Stellar Objects and two Active Galactic Nuclei. The coolest WISE-discovered
brown dwarfs are the closest of their type and will remain the only sample of

a sphere, with emphasis on detecting signatures of melting transitions. This
system is relevant to Ising-type quantum Hall states, and is unconventional in
the sense that it features particles interacting via two different
two-dimensional Coulomb interactions. One species of particles in the plasma
carries charge of both types (Q_1,Q_2), while the other species carries only
charge of the second type (0,-Q_2). We find signatures of a freezing transition
at Q_1^2 approximately 140. This means that the species with charge of both
types will form a Wigner crystal, whereas the species with charge of the second
type also shows signatures of being a Wigner crystal, due to the attractive
inter-component interaction of the second type. Moreover, there is also a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition at Q_2^2 approximately 4, at
which the two species of particles bind to form molecules that are neutral with
respect to the second Coulomb interaction. These two transitions appear to be
independent of each other, giving a rectangular phase diagram. As a special
case, Q_2=0 describes the (conventional) two-dimensional one-component plasma.
Our study is consistent with previous studies of this plasma, and sheds new

identified as an overdensity of four optically-selected QSOs at z = 2.23 within
a 15x15 arcmin^2 region. Narrow-band imaging in the near-IR revealed that the
structure contains an additional overdensity of 22 z = 2.23 Halpha-emitting
galaxies (HAEs), resulting in 23 unique z = 2.23 HAEs/QSOs. Our Chandra
observations reveal that 3 HAEs in addition to the 4 QSOs harbor powerfully
accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with 2-10 keV luminosities of
~(8-60) x 10^43 ergs/s and X-ray spectral slopes consistent with unobscured
AGN. Using a large comparison sample of 210 HAEs in Chandra-COSMOS (C-COSMOS),
we find suggestive evidence that the AGN fraction increases with local HAE
galaxy density. The 2QZ Clus HAEs reside in a moderately overdense environment
(a factor of ~2 times over the field), and after excluding optically-selected
QSOs, we find the AGN fraction is a factor of ~3.5^+3.8_-2.2 times higher than
C-COSMOS HAEs in similar environments. Using stacking analyses of the Chandra
data and Herschel SPIRE observations at 250 um, we respectively estimate mean
SMBH accretion rates (Mdot) and star-formation rates (SFRs) for the 2QZ Clus
and C-COSMOS samples. We find that the mean 2QZ Clus HAE stacked 2-10 keV
luminosity is QSO-like (~6-10 x 10^43 ergs/s), and the implied Mdot/SFR \sim
(1.6-3.2) x10^-3 is broadly consistent with the local MBH/M* relation and z ~ 2
X-ray selected AGN. The C-COSMOS HAEs are on average an order of magnitude less
X-ray luminous and have Mdot/SFR \sim (0.2-0.4) x10^-3, comparable to z ~ 1-2
star-forming galaxies with similar mean X-ray luminosities. We estimate that a
periodic QSO phase with duty cycle ~2-8% would be sufficient to bring the
star-forming galaxies onto the local MBH/M* relation.

ergoregion extends all the way from the black hole horizon to infinity. We give
a self-contained account of the solution-generating procedure, including
including explicit formulae for the metric and the vector potential. In the
case when $Q= jB(1+ 1/4 j^2 B^4)$, we show that there is an arbitrariness in
the choice of asymptotically timelike Killing field $K_\Omega=
\partial/\partial t+ \Omega \partial/\partial \phi$, because there is no
canonical choice of $\Omega$. For one choice, $\Omega=\Omega_s$, the metric is
asymptotically static, and there is an ergoregion confined to the neighbourhood
of the horizon. On the other hand, by choosing $\Omega=\Omega_H$, so that
$K_{\Omega_H}$ is co-rotating with the horizon, then for sufficiently large $B$
numerical studies indicate there is no ergoregion at all. For smaller values,
in a range $B_-<B<B_+$, there is a toroidal ergoregion outside and disjoint
from the horizon. If $B\le B_-$ this ergoregion expands all the way to infinity
in a cylindrical region near to the rotation axis. For black holes whose size

\gamma-ray binary system PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 taken around its periastron
passage (15th of December 2010) with the High Energy Stereoscopic System
(H.E.S.S.) of Cherenkov Telescopes. We aim to search for a possible TeV
counterpart of the GeV flare detected by the Fermi LAT. In addition, we aim to
study the current periastron passage in the context of previous observations
taken at similar orbital phases, testing the repetitive behavior of the source.
  Methods. Observations at VHE were conducted with H.E.S.S. from 9th to 16th of
January 2011. The total dataset amounts to around 6 h of observing time.
  Results. The source is detected in the 2011 data at a significance level of
11.5\sigma\ revealing an averaged integral flux above 1 TeV of (1.01 \pm
0.18_{stat} \pm 0.20_{sys}) \times 10^{-12} cm^{-2}s^{-1}. The differential
energy spectrum follows a power-law shape with a spectral index \Gamma = 2.92
\pm 0.30_{stat} \pm 0.20_{sys} and a flux normalisation at 1 TeV of N_{0} =
1.95 \pm 0.32_{stat} \pm 0.39_{sys}) \times 10^{-12} TeV^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1}.
The measured lightcurve does not show any evidence for variability of the
source on the daily scale.
  Conclusions. The measured integral flux and the spectral shape of the 2011
data are compatible with the results obtained around previous periastron
passages. The absence of variability in the H.E.S.S. data indicates that the
GeV flare observed by Fermi LAT in the time period covered also by H.E.S.S.
observations originates in a different physical scenario than the TeV emission.
Additionaly, new results compared to those obtained in the observations which
were performed in 2004 at a similar orbital phase, further support the
hypothesis of the repetitive behavior of the source.

ranking genes, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation regions, and
other high-throughput features for association with disease. We propose a new
approach, called gene set bagging, for measuring the stability of ranking
procedures using predefined gene sets. Gene set bagging involves resampling the
original high-throughput data, performing gene-set analysis on the resampled
data, and confirming that biological categories replicate. This procedure can
be thought of as bootstrapping gene-set analysis and can be used to determine
which are the most reproducible gene sets. Results: Here we apply this approach
to two common genomics applications: gene expression and DNA methylation. Even
with state-of-the-art statistical ranking procedures, significant categories in
a gene set enrichment analysis may be unstable when subjected to resampling.
Conclusions: We demonstrate that gene lists are not necessarily stable, and
therefore additional steps like gene set bagging can improve biological
inference of gene set analysis.

as of yet, not been many actionable generalised theoretical conclusions. To
address this point, we have created a hybrid, discrete/continuous computational
cellular automaton model of a generalised stem-cell driven tissue and explored
the phenotypic traits inherent in the inciting cell and the resultant tissue
growth. We identify the regions in phenotype parameter space where these
initiating cells are able to cause a disruption in homeostasis, leading to
tissue overgrowth and tumour formation. As our parameters and model are
non-specific, they could apply to any tissue cancer stem-cell and do not assume
specific genetic mutations. In this way, our model suggests that targeting
these phenotypic traits could represent generalizable strategies across cancer
types and represents a first attempt to identify the hallmarks of cancer stem
cells.

geographical regions where a potential second and third telescope could be

Bai and Silverstein proved, under certain assumptions on the model, that for

no eigenvalues of $M_N$ will appear in this interval for all $N$ large. In this

re- move these artifacts, but they are designed to be used in population
studies. But genomic technologies are beginning to be used in clinical

this paper, we propose an new method called frozen surrogate variable analysis

for the soliton's maximum amplitude show a recurrent phenomenon, and are
similar to those of the cubic Duffing equation. It is also shown that the phase

(adsorption energy), elastic moduli, electronic structure, band gaps, and
effective electron masses as a function of the density of the adsorbed

decreases with the growing concentration of attachments and we determine the
critical density of the molecules that can be chemisorbed on the surface of
GLs. Because of local deformations of GLs and sp3 rehybridization of the bonds
induced by fragments, elastic moduli decrease with increasing number of groups.
Simultaneously, we observe that the functionalizing molecules stretch the
graphenes lattice, the effect being more pronounced for higher concentration of
adsorbed molecules. We find out that the GLs functionalization leads in many
cases to the opening of the graphene band gap (up to 0.5302 eV for 12.5%

consistent with the lack of incontrovertible transit timing variations (TTVs)

continuous observations from space-based platforms). However, even in systems

for FPGA-based architectures intended for deployment on ASKAP and other SKA
precursors for fast transients surveys. Unlike conventional CPU- and
GPU-optimized incoherent dedispersion algorithms, this algorithm has the
freedom to maximize the S/N by way of programmable dispersion profiles that
enable the inclusion of different numbers of time samples per spectral channel.
This allows, for example, more samples to be summed at lower frequencies where
intra-channel dispersion smearing is larger, or it could even be used to
optimize the dedispersion sum for steep spectrum sources. Our analysis takes
into account the intrinsic pulse width, scatter broadening, spectral index and
dispersion measure of the signal, and the system's frequency range, spectral
and temporal resolution, and number of trial dedispersions. We show that the
system achieves better than 80% of the optimal S/N where the temporal
resolution and the intra-channel smearing time are smaller than a quarter of
the average width of the pulse across the system's frequency band (after
including scatter smearing). Coarse temporal resolutions suffer a
Delta_t^(-1/2) decay in S/N, and coarse spectral resolutions cause a
Delta_nu^(-1/2) decay in S/N, where Delta_t and Delta_nu are the temporal and
spectral resolutions of the system, respectively. We show how the system's S/N
compares with that of matched filter and boxcar filter detectors. We further
present a new algorithm for selecting trial dispersion measures for a survey
that maintains a given minimum S/N performance across a range of dispersion
measures.

organismic functions, fitness, and evolution. Complex phenotypes, which are
also called quantitative traits, often depend on multiple genomic loci. Their
evolution builds on genome evolution in a complicated way, which involves
selection, genetic drift, mutations and recombination. Here we develop a
coarse-grained evolutionary statistics for phenotypes, which decouples from
details of the underlying genotypes. We derive approximate evolution equations
for the distribution of phenotype values within and across populations. This
dynamics covers evolutionary processes at high and low recombination rates,
that is, it applies to sexual and asexual populations. In a fitness landscape
with a single optimal phenotype value, the phenotypic diversity within
populations and the divergence between populations reach evolutionary
equilibria, which describe stabilizing selection. We compute the equilibrium
distributions of both quantities analytically and we show that the ratio of
mean divergence and diversity depends on the strength of selection in a
universal way: it is largely independent of the phenotype's genomic encoding
and of the recombination rate. This establishes a new method for the inference
of selection on molecular phenotypes beyond the genome level. We discuss the
implications of our findings for the predictability of evolutionary processes.

conclude that Abell 48 is a planetary nebula (PN) around an evolved low-mass
star, rather than a Population I ejecta nebula. Importantly, the surrounding
nebula has a morphology typical of PNe, and is not enriched in nitrogen, and
thus not the `peeled atmosphere' of a massive star. We estimate a distance of
1.6 kpc and a reddening, E(B-V) = 1.90 mag, the latter value clearly showing
the nebula lies on the near side of the Galactic bar, and cannot be a massive
WN star. The ionized mass (~0.3 M_Sun) and electron density (700 cm^-3) are
typical of middle-aged PNe. The observed stellar spectrum was compared to a
grid of models from the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) grid. The best fit
temperature is 71 kK, and the atmospheric composition is dominated by helium
with an upper limit on the hydrogen abundance of 10 per cent. Our results are
in very good agreement with the recent study of Todt et al., who determined a
hydrogen fraction of 10 per cent and an unusually large nitrogen fraction of ~5
per cent. This fraction is higher than any other low-mass H-deficient star, and
is not readily explained by current post-AGB models. We give a discussion of
the implications of this discovery for the late-stage evolution of
intermediate-mass stars. There is now tentative evidence for two distinct
helium-dominated post-AGB lineages, separate to the helium and carbon dominated
surface compositions produced by a late thermal pulse. Further theoretical work

asynchronous network, despite the presence of Byzantine failures: some nodes
are malicious and behave arbitrarly. We focus on non-cryptographic solutions.
Most existing approaches give conditions for perfect reliable broadcast (all
correct nodes deliver the good information), but require a highly connected
network. A probabilistic approach was recently proposed for loosely connected
networks: the Byzantine failures are randomly distributed, and the correct
nodes deliver the good information with high probability. A first solution
require the nodes to initially know their position on the network, which may be
difficult or impossible in self-organizing or dynamic networks. A second
solution relaxed this hypothesis but has much weaker Byzantine tolerance
guarantees. In this paper, we propose a parameterizable broadcast protocol that
does not require nodes to have any knowledge about the network. We give a
deterministic technique to compute a set of nodes that always deliver authentic
information, for a given set of Byzantine failures. Then, we use this technique
to experimentally evaluate our protocol, and show that it significantely
outperforms previous solutions with the same hypotheses. Important disclaimer:

to a Riemann-Hilbert problem using the Hurd's method. Secondly, the
Riemann-Hilbert problem is embedded into a family of Riemann-Hilbert problems
indexed by a variable b taking values on a half-line. A linear ordinary

matrix factorization becomes reduced to two runs of solving of ordinary
differential equations on a half-line: first ODE2 for the coefficient of ODE1,
and then ODE1 for the unknown function. The efficiency of the new method is
demonstrated on some examples.

the confined phase, becomes infrared finite in the deconfined phase, while the

rates (SFR) and a high AGN (Seyfert and AGN/starburst composite) incidence.
Therefore, they are ideal candidates to explore the co-evolution of black hole
(BH) growth and star formation (SF) activity, not necessarily associated with
major mergers. Here, we use Spitzer/IRS spectroscopy of a complete
volume-limited sample of local LIRGs (distances of <78Mpc). We estimate typical
BH masses of 3x10^7 M_sun using [NeIII]15.56micron and optical [OIII]5007A gas
velocity dispersions and literature stellar velocity dispersions. We find that
in a large fraction of local LIRGs the current SFR is taking place not only in
the inner nuclear ~1.5kpc region, as estimated from the nuclear 11.3micron PAH
luminosities, but also in the host galaxy. We next use the ratios between the
SFRs and BH accretion rates (BHAR) to study whether the SF activity and BH
growth are contemporaneous in local LIRGs. On average, local LIRGs have SFR to
BHAR ratios higher than those of optically selected Seyferts of similar AGN
luminosities. However, the majority of the IR-bright galaxies in the RSA
Seyfert sample behave like local LIRGs. Moreover, the AGN incidence tends to be
higher in local LIRGs with the lowest SFRs. All this suggests that in local
LIRGs there is a distinct IR-bright star forming phase taking place prior to
the bulk of the current BH growth (i.e., AGN phase). The latter is reflected
first as a composite and then as a Seyfert, and later as a non-LIRG optically
identified Seyfert nucleus with moderate SF in its host galaxy.

(GPU), have gained significant traction in scientific and statistical
computing. They are particularly well-suited to data-parallel algorithms such
as the particle filter, or more generally Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), which
are increasingly used in statistical inference. SMC methods carry a set of
weighted particles through repeated propagation, weighting and resampling
steps. The propagation and weighting steps are straightforward to parallelise,
as they require only independent operations on each particle. The resampling
step is more difficult, as standard schemes require a collective operation,
such as a sum, across particle weights. Focusing on this resampling step, we
analyse two alternative schemes that do not involve a collective operation
(Metropolis and rejection resamplers), and compare them to standard schemes
(multinomial, stratified and systematic resamplers). We find that, in certain
circumstances, the alternative resamplers can perform significantly faster on a
GPU, and to a lesser extent on a CPU, than the standard approaches. Moreover,
in single precision, the standard approaches are numerically biased for upwards
of hundreds of thousands of particles, while the alternatives are not. This is
particularly important given greater single- than double-precision throughput
on modern devices, and the consequent temptation to use single precision with a
greater number of particles. Finally, we provide auxiliary functions useful for
implementation, such as for the permutation of ancestry vectors to enable
in-place propagation.

are revisited to study the property of dust grains in the Milky Way (MW) and
the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We confirm that the graphite-silicate mixture
of grains yields the observed extinction curve with the simple power-law
distribution of the grain size but with a cutoff at some maximal size: the
parameters are tightly constrained to be $q = 3.5 \pm 0.2$ for the size
distribution $a^{-q}$ and the maximum radius $a_{max} = 0.24 \pm 0.05$ um, for
both MW and SMC. The abundance of grains, and hence the elemental abundance, is
constrained from the reddening versus hydrogen column density, E(B-V)/N_H. If
we take the solar elemental abundance as the standard for the MW, >56 % of
carbon should be in graphite dust, while it is <40 % in the SMC using its
available abundance estimate. This disparity and the relative abundance of C to
Si explain the difference of the two curves. We find that 50-60 % of carbon may
not necessarily be in graphite but in the amorphous or the glassy phase. Iron
may also be in the metallic phase or up to ~80 % in magnetite rather than in
silicates, so that the Mg/Fe ratio in astronomical olivine is arbitrary. With
these substitutions the parameters of the grain size remain unchanged. The mass
density of dust grains relative to hydrogen is $\rho_{dust}/\rho_H = 1/(120
{+10 \atop -16})$ for the MW and $1/(760 {+70 \atop -90}) for the SMC under
some abundance constraints. We underline the importance of the
wavelength-dependence slope of the extinction curve in the near infrared in
constructing the dust model: if $A_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^{-gamma}$ with
gamma ~ 1.6, the power-law grain-size model fails, whereas it works if gamma ~
1.8-2.0.

Starting from a multiband Hubbard model, we show that the charge carriers
introduced by doping are bound to the Ca defects with large binding energy of
about 1 eV at small doping, and give rise to the in-gap absorption band
observed in the optical spectroscopy. The central position of a generic Ca
defect with eight equidistant vanadium neighbors implies a partly filled defect
band and permits activated transport due to Coulomb disorder. We explore the
effect of bound charge carriers on the dynamics of the (yz,zx) orbital and spin
degrees of freedom in the context of a spin-orbital t-J model. After deriving
the superexchange interactions around the doped hole, we show that the
transition from G-type to C-type antiferromagnetic (AF) order is triggered by
the kinetic energy of doped holes via the double-exchange mechanism. The defect
states lead to local modification of orbital correlations within ferromagnetic
chains along the c axis; some of them contain hole defects, while the
charge-orbital coupling suppresses locally (yz,zx) orbital fluctuations in the
others. Thereby, Ca defects provide a physical mechanism for spin-orbital
dimerization along the ferromagnetic bonds, suggesting that, in the C-AF phase
of weakly doped Y1-xCaxVO3, dimerization increases with doping.

number $N$ of static equilibrium points of a convex solid $K$. We call the
normalized volume of the minimally necessary truncation robustness and we seek
shapes with maximal robustness for fixed values of $N$. While the upward
robustness (referring to the increase of $N$) of smooth, homogeneous convex
solids is known to be zero, little is known about their downward robustness.
The difficulty of the latter problem is related to the coupling (via integrals)
between the geometry of the hull $\bd K$ and the location of the center of
gravity $G$. Here we first investigate two simpler, decoupled problems by
examining truncations of $\bd K$ with $G$ fixed, and displacements of $G$ with
$\bd K$ fixed, leading to the concept of external \rm and internal \rm
robustness, respectively. In dimension 2, we find that for any fixed number
$N=2S$, the convex solids with both maximal external and maximal internal
robustness are regular $S$-gons. Based on this result we conjecture that
regular polygons have maximal downward robustness also in the original, coupled
problem. We also show that in the decoupled problems, 3-dimensional regular
polyhedra have maximal internal robustness, however, only under additional
constraints. Finally, we prove results for the full problem in case of 3
dimensional solids. These results appear to explain why monostatic pebbles
(with either one stable, or one unstable point of equilibrium) are found so
rarely in Nature.

the desired light-curve signals is presented. By not assuming any prior, nor

trade-off between a higher degree of objectivity for the non-parametric methods

They create/annihilate $k$-quanta, $k$ being a positive integer. We start with
giving an alternative description to the already found static magnetic flux
tube solutions of the noncommutative gauge theories in terms of generalized
Bose operators. The Nielsen-Olesen vortex solutions found in terms of these
operators reduce to the already found ones. On the contrary we find a class of
new instaton solutions which are unitarily inequivalant to the the ones found
from ADHM construction on noncommutative space. The charge of the instaton has
a description in terms of the index representing the reducibility of the Fock
space, i.e., $k$. After studying the static solitonic solutions in
noncommutative Minkowski space and the instaton solutions in noncommutative
Euclidean space we go on to study the implications of the time-space
noncommutativity in Minkowski space. To understand it properly we study the
time-dependent transitions of a forced harmonic oscillator in noncommutative

found results in the context of quantum optics. We then shift to the so called
DSR theories which are related to a different kind of noncommutative

as a source of highly confined coherent electron wavepackets with attosecond
duration and strong directivity. The possibility to steer, control or switch
such electron wavepackets by light is expected to pave the way towards direct
visualization of nanoplasmonic field dynamics and real-time probing of electron
motion in solid state nanostructures. Such pulses can be generated by
strong-field induced tunneling and acceleration of electrons in the near-field
of sharp gold tapers within one half-cycle of the driving laser field. Here, we
show the effect of the carrier-envelope phase of the laser field on the
generation and motion of strong-field emitted electrons from such tips. This is
a step forward towards controlling the coherent electron motion in and around
metallic nanostructures on ultrashort length and time scales.

level of neural networks for a learning task on which all the state-of-the-art
machine learning algorithms tested failed to learn. We motivate our work from
the hypothesis that humans learn such intermediate concepts from other
individuals via a form of supervision or guidance using a curriculum. The
experiments we have conducted provide positive evidence in favor of this
hypothesis. In our experiments, a two-tiered MLP architecture is trained on a
dataset with 64x64 binary inputs images, each image with three sprites. The
final task is to decide whether all the sprites are the same or one of them is
different. Sprites are pentomino tetris shapes and they are placed in an image
with different locations using scaling and rotation transformations. The first
part of the two-tiered MLP is pre-trained with intermediate-level targets being
the presence of sprites at each location, while the second part takes the
output of the first part as input and predicts the final task's target binary
event. The two-tiered MLP architecture, with a few tens of thousand examples,
was able to learn the task perfectly, whereas all other algorithms (include
unsupervised pre-training, but also traditional algorithms like SVMs, decision
trees and boosting) all perform no better than chance. We hypothesize that the
optimization difficulty involved when the intermediate pre-training is not
performed is due to the {\em composition} of two highly non-linear tasks. Our
findings are also consistent with hypotheses on cultural learning inspired by
the observations of optimization problems with deep learning, presumably
because of effective local minima.

IceCube experiment has raised serious questions on our understanding of GRB's
and the mechanism of neutrino flux production in them. Motivated by this and
the need for a precise calculation for GRB neutrino flux, here we study the
effects of beyond standard model physics on the GRB neutrino flux. In the
internal shock model of GRB, high energy neutrinos are expected from muon, pion
and kaon decays. Using the latest best fit neutrino oscillation parameters, we
compute the expected flux on earth for standard as well as non-standard
oscillation scenarios. Among the non-standard scenarios, we consider neutrino
decay, pseudo-dirac nature of neutrinos and presence of one eV scale light
sterile neutrino. Incorporating other experimental bounds on these new physics
scenarios, we show that neutrino decay scenario can significantly alter the
neutrino flux on earth from the expected ones whereas the corresponding changes
for pseudo-dirac and sterile neutrino cases are moderate.

little is known about the physical mechanisms that govern the scattering of

understanding of these interactions promises not only new biological insights
into structure and dynamics of flagella and cilia, but may also lead to new
microfluidic techniques for controlling cell motility and microbial locomotion,

protein synthesis and photosynthetic biofuel production. Due to fundamental
differences in physiology and swimming strategies, it is an open question
whether microfluidic transport and rectification schemes that have recently
been demonstrated for pusher-type microswimmers such as bacteria and sperm
cells, can be transferred to puller-type algae and other motile eukaryotes, as
it is not known whether long-range hydrodynamic or short-range mechanical
forces dominate the surface interactions of these microorganisms. Here, using
high-speed microscopic imaging, we present direct experimental evidence that
the surface scattering of both mammalian sperm cells and unicellular green
algae is primarily governed by direct ciliary contact interactions. Building on
this insight, we predict and verify experimentally the existence of optimal
microfluidic ratchets that maximize rectification of initially uniform

massive YSOs to date, providing a valuable resource for the study of massive
star formation. In this paper we present our exploratory analysis of the data.
The YSOs observed have a wide range of embeddedness (2.7 < A_V < 114),
demonstrating that this study covers minimally obscured objects right through
to very red, dusty sources. Almost all YSOs show some evidence for emission
lines, though there is a wide variety of observed properties. The most commonly
detected lines are Brgamma, H_2, fluorescent FeII, CO bandhead, [FeII] and HeI
2-1 2^1S-2^1P, in order of frequency of occurrence. In total, ~40% of the YSOs
display either fluorescent FeII 1.6878um or CO bandhead emission (or both),
indicative of a circumstellar disc; however, no correlation of the strength of
these lines with bolometric luminosity was found. We also find that ~60% of the
sources exhibit [FeII] or H_2 emission, indicating the presence of an outflow.
Three quarters of all sources have Brgamma in emission. A good correlation with
bolometric luminosity was observed for both the Brgamma and H_2 emission line
strengths, covering 1 L_solar< L_BOL < 3.5x10^5 L_solar. This suggests that the
emission mechanism for these lines is the same for low-, intermediate-, and
high-mass YSOs, i.e. high-mass YSOs appear to resemble scaled-up versions of
low-mass YSOs.

drastically affect the magnetic and transport properties in disordered/diluted

these systems still remains to be explored in more details as can be seen from
the scarce literature available. We present a detailed theoretical analysis of
the effects of nanoscale inhomogeneities on the spin excitation spectrum in
diluted magnetic systems. The calculations are performed on relatively large
systems (up to $N$=$66^3$). It is found that even low concentrations of
inhomogeneities have drastic effects on both the magnon density of states and
magnon excitations. These effects become even more pronounced in the case of
short ranged magnetic interactions between the impurities. In contrast to the
increase of critical temperatures $T_C$, reported in previous studies, the
spin-stiffness $D$ is systematically suppressed in the presence of nanoscale
inhomogeneities. Moreover $D$ is found to strongly depend on the
inhomogeneities' concentration, the cluster size, as well as the range of the
magnetic interactions. The findings are discussed in the prospect of potential

plasmonic ridge antennas with lengths ranging from 100 to 2000 nm. We measure
the antenna's standing wave resonances up to the fifth order and measure the
dispersion of the strongly confined guided plasmon mode. By directly detecting
the emitted antenna radiation with a 2D CCD camera we are able to measure the
angular emission patterns associated with each individual antenna resonance. We
demonstrate that the shortest ridges can be modeled as a single point dipole
emitter oriented either upward (m=0) or in-plane (m=1). The far-field emission
pattern for longer antennas (m>2) is well described by two interfering in-plane
point dipoles at the end facets giving rise to an angular fringe pattern, where
the number of fringes increases as the antenna becomes longer. Taking advantage
of the deep subwavelength excitation resolution of the cathodoluminescence
technique, we are able to determine the antenna radiation pattern as function
of excitation position. By including the phase of the radiating dipoles into
our simple dipole model we completely reproduce this effect. This work
demonstrates how angle-resolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy can be used to
fully determine the emission properties of subwavelength ridge antennas, which
ultimately can be used for the design of more complex and efficient antenna
structures.

O_{d,\epsilon}(N^{1/d+\epsilon}) integer points within the box. Importantly,
the implied constant makes no reference to the coefficients of the curve.
Examples of certain rational curves show that this bound is tight but it has
long been thought that when restricted to non-rational curves an improvement
should be possible whilst maintaining the uniformity of the bound. In this
paper we consider this problem restricted to elliptic curves and show that for
a large family of these curves the Bombieri-Pila bounds can be improved. The

expurgated ensembles of fixed composition codes over finite alphabets, our
basic expurgated bound coincides with the CKM expurgated bound, which is in
general tighter than Gallager's bound, but with equality for the optimum type
class of codewords. Our method, however, extends beyond fixed composition codes
and beyond finite alphabets, where it is natural to impose input constraints
(e.g., power limitation). In such cases, the CKM expurgated bound may not apply
directly, and our bound is in general tighter than Gallager's bound. In
addition, while both the CKM and the Gallager expurgated bounds are based on
Bhattacharyya bound for bounding the pairwise error probabilities, our bound
allows the more general Chernoff distance measure, thus giving rise to
additional improvement using the Chernoff parameter as a degree of freedom to

The two regimes have well differentiated transport properties and, in the

modified longitudinal viscosity and sound speed. The crossover between the two

at least three vertices can be reconstructed up to isomorphism from its deck -
the collection of its vertex-deleted subgraphs. Kocay's Lemma is an important
tool in graph reconstruction. Roughly speaking, given the deck of a graph $G$
and any finite sequence of graphs, it gives a linear constraint that every
reconstruction of $G$ must satisfy.
  Let $\psi(n)$ be the number of distinct (mutually non-isomorphic) graphs on
$n$ vertices, and let $d(n)$ be the number of distinct decks that can be
constructed from these graphs. Then the difference $\psi(n) - d(n)$ measures
how many graphs cannot be reconstructed from their decks. In particular, the
graph reconstruction conjecture is true for $n$-vertex graphs if and only if
$\psi(n) = d(n)$.
  We give a framework based on Kocay's lemma to study this discrepancy. We
prove that if $M$ is a matrix of covering numbers of graphs by sequences of
graphs, then $d(n) \geq \mathsf{rank}_\mathbb{R}(M)$. In particular, all
$n$-vertex graphs are reconstructible if one such matrix has rank $\psi(n)$. To
complement this result, we prove that it is possible to choose a family of

alignment. The dynamics of such systems is governed solely by interactions
among individuals or ""agents,"" with the tendency to adjust to their
`environmental averages'. This, in turn, leads to the formation of clusters,
e.g., colonies of ants, flocks of birds, parties of people, etc. A natural
question which arises in this context is to understand when and how clusters
emerge through the self-alignment of agents, and what type of ""rules of
engagement"" influence the formation of such clusters. Of particular interest to
us are cases in which the self-organized behavior tends to concentrate into one
cluster, reflecting a consensus of opinions, flocking or concentration of other
positions intrinsic to the dynamics.
  Many standard models for self-organized dynamics in social, biological and
physical science assume that the intensity of alignment increases as agents get
closer, reflecting a common tendency to align with those who think or act
alike. Moreover, ""Similarity breeds connection,"" reflects our intuition that
increasing the intensity of alignment as the difference of positions decreases,
is more likely to lead to a consensus. We argue here that the converse is true:
when the dynamics is driven by local interactions, it is more likely to
approach a consensus when the interactions among agents \emph{increase} as a
function of their difference in position. \emph{Heterophily} --- the tendency
to bond more with those who are different rather than with those who are
similar, plays a decisive r\^{o}le in the process of clustering. We point out
that the number of clusters in heterophilious dynamics \emph{decreases} as the
heterophily dependence among agents increases. In particular, sufficiently
strong heterophilious interactions enhance consensus.

spectroscopy as well as by spatially resolved CL and energy dispersive x-ray

accompanied by an increasing indium content toward the surface of the (In,Ga)N

identify the strained bottom, unstrained top, and gradually relaxed
intermediate region of the (In,Ga)N layer. In addition to an increase of the
indium content along the growth direction, the strain relaxation leads to an
enhancement of the lateral variations of the indium distribution toward the
surface.

dielectric properties. Composites were found to have better thermal stability
than that of pure PMMA. However, there was no significant difference in the
glass transition (Tg) temperature between the polymer and the composite. The
appearance of additional vibrational frequencies in the range 400-600 cm-1 in
FTIR spectra indicated a possible interaction between PMMA and CCTO. The
composite, with 38 Vol % of CCTO (in PMMA), exhibited remarkably low dielectric
loss at high frequencies and the low frequency relaxation is attributed to the
space charge polarization/MWS effect. The origin of AC conductivity
particularly in the high frequency region was attributed to the electronic
polarization.

(anti)calorons in introducing non-thermal behavior effectively described in
terms of Planck's quantum of action $\hbar$. This non-thermality cancels
exactly between the ground-state estimate and its free quasiparticle
excitations. Kinematic constraints in 4-vertex scattering and the counting of
radial loop variables versus the number of independent constraints on them are
re-visited. Next, we consider thermal 2$\rightarrow$ 2 one-loop scattering of
the modes remaining massless upon the (anti)caloron induced adjoint Higgs
mechanism (thermal ground state after spatial coarse graining). Starting with
stringent analytical arguments, we are able to exclude the contribution to
photon-photon scattering from diagrams containing at least one three-vertex
and, in a next step, a vast majority of all possible configurations involving
two four-vertices. By numerical analysis we show that the remaining
contribution of the overall S channel is severely suppressed compared to that
of the T and U channels, meaning that the creation of a pair of massive vector
modes by a pair of photons and vice versa practically does not occur in the
Yang-Mills plasma. For the T and U channels the domain of loop integration
represents less than $10^{-7}$ times the volume of the unconstrained
integration region. The thus introduced photon-photon correlation should affect
the Cosmic Microwave Background's polarisation at low redshift. An adaption of
the here-developed methods to the analysis of irreducible bubble diagrams could
prove the conjecture of hep-th/0609033 on the termination of the loop expansion
of thermodynamical quantities at a finite irreducible order.

Maxwell-like field equations. As in the Maxwell's formulation, the particle
fields are represented by a scalar, $\psi_0$ and a vector $\vec{\psi}$. The
analogy with Maxwell's equations requires that the inertial fields are
$\vec{E}_D=c^2\vec{\alpha}\times\vec{\psi}$, and
$\vec{B}_D=\vec{\alpha}\,\psi_0+c\beta\,\vec{\psi}$ and that
$\psi_0=-c\beta\,\vec{\alpha}\cdot\vec{\psi}$, where $\beta$, $\vec{\alpha}$
and $c$ are the Dirac matrices and the speed of light, respectively. An
alternative solution suggests that magnetic monopole-like behavior accompanies
Dirac's field. In this formulation, a field-like representation of Dirac's
particle is derived. It is shown that when the vector field of the particle,
$\vec{\psi}$, is normal to the vector $\vec{\alpha}$, Dirac's field represents
a medium with maximal conductivity. The energy flux (Poynting vector) of the
Dirac's fields is found to flow in opposite direction to the particle's motion.
A system of equivalently symmetrized Maxwell's equations is introduced. A
longitudinal (scalar) wave traveling at speed of light is found to accompany
magnetic charges flow. This wave is not affected by presence of electric
charges and currents. The Lorentz boost transformations of the matter fields
are equivalent to $c\vec{\psi}\,'

from formal presentations, with discussion, workshop-style formats or informal

tight control of systematic effects is needed in optical systems employing

on the large-Nc limit where Nc is the number of colors. We then explain the
liquid-gas phase transition and the inhomogeneous meson condensation in nuclear
matter with emphasis put on the relevance to quark matter. We commence the next
part focused on quark matter with the bootstrap model and the Hagedorn
temperature. Then we turn to properties associated with chiral symmetry and
exposit theoretical descriptions of the chiral phase transition. There emerge
some quark-matter counterparts of phenomena seen in nuclear matter such as the
liquid-gas phase transition and the inhomogeneous structure of the chiral
condensate. The third regime that is being recognized recently is what is
called quarkyonic matter, which has both aspects of nuclear and quark matter.

Improving the quantum coherence of these systems, for instance spin qubits or

Charge noise results in a fluctuating electric field, spin noise in a
fluctuating magnetic field at the location of the qubit, and both can lead to
dephasing and decoherence of optical and spin states. We investigate noise in
an ultra-pure semiconductor using a minimally-invasive, ultra-sensitive, local
probe: resonance fluorescence from a single quantum dot. We distinguish between
charge noise and spin noise via a crucial difference in their optical
signatures. Noise spectra for both electric and magnetic fields are derived.
The noise spectrum of the charge noise can be fully described by the
fluctuations in an ensemble of localized charge defects in the semiconductor.

thermostatic loads, this paper proposes a two level feedback system design
between the independent system operator (ISO) and the regulation service
provider such that two objectives are achieved: (1) the ISO can optimally
dispatch regulation signals to multiple providers in real time in order to
reduce the requirement for expensive spinning reserves, and (2) each regulation
provider can control its thermostatic loads to respond the ISO signal. It is
also shown that the amount of regulation service that can be provided is
implicitly restricted by a few fundamental parameters of the provider itself,
such as the allowable set point choice and its thermal constant. An interesting
finding is that the regulation provider's ability to provide a large amount of
long term accumulated regulation and short term signal tracking restrict each
other. Simulation results are presented to verify and illustrate the

Paris, Leiden and Tunis, Ahmadiya. A reading of this treatise of al-Kh\={a}zin
proves that this mathematician did a profound study of the Xth book of Euclid
Elements, in order to gain a global comprehension. In effect, he presented a
condensed commentary, the originality of which can be felt both on the formal
and the contents levels. The aim of our study is to try, as much as possible,
to show this originality, referring specially to Pappus commentary of the ""Xth
book"", the works of R. Rashed on the history of algebra and a recent work of M.
Ben Miled on the Arabic commentaries of the Xth book. It appears to us that the
work of al-Kh\={a}zin concerning the Xth book, is situated in the current of an
Arabic tradition identified, mainly due to the works of R. Rashed, by: - an
algebraic representation of the geometrical work of Euclid, - a numerical
interpretation of the Euclidian notions, rendered possible by the introduction
of a unity for every kind of magnitude.

In order to solve the proposed optimization problem efficiently, we develop
joint adaptive power allocation and interference suppression algorithms that
can be implemented in a distributed fashion. The proposed stochastic gradient
(SG) and recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms mitigate the interference by
adjusting the power levels across the relays and estimating the parameters of

neighbouring HII region type nebulosity. Follow-up optical spectroscopy was
undertaken, sampling carefully across prominent features of these faint

to an osmolyte solution is obtained using the transfer free energy of (Gly)_n
with the added assumption that a constant incremental change in free energy
with n implies that each additional unit makes an independent contribution to
the free energy. Here we test this assumption and uncover its limitations.
Together with results for cyclic-diglycine, we show that, in principle, it is
not possible to obtain a peptide group transfer free energy that is independent
of the model system. We calculate the hydration free energy of
acetyl-(Gly)_n-methyl amide (n=1..7) peptides modeled in the extended
conformation in water and osmolyte solutions and find that the hydration free
energy is linear in n, suggestive of independent, additive group-contributions.
To probe the observed linearity further, we study the hydration of the solute
bereft of water molecules in the first hydration shell. This conditioned solute
arises naturally in the theoretical formulation and helps us focus on hydration
effects uncluttered by the complexities of short-range solute-water
interactions. We subdivide the conditioned solute into n+1 peptide groups and a
methyl end group. The binding energy of each of these groups with the solvent
is Gaussian distributed, but the near neighbor binding energies are themselves
correlated: the (i,i+1) correlation is the strongest and tends to lower the
free energy over the independent group case. We show that the observed
linearity can be explained by the similarity of near neighbor correlations.
Implications for group additive transfer free energy models are indicated.

finite length $K$ from a source to one or more destinations as in, e.g., file
transfer. To ensure that no data is lost, it must be combined with rateless
erasure correcting schemes on a higher layer, such as a time-division multiple
access (TDMA) system paired with automatic repeat request (ARQ) or random
linear network coding (RLNC). We consider binary channel coding on a binary
symmetric channel (BSC) and q-ary RLNC for erasure correction in a star
network, where Y sources send messages to each other with the help of a central
relay. In this scenario RLNC has been shown to have a throughput advantage over
TDMA schemes as K and q tend to infinity. In this paper we focus on finite
block lengths and compare the expected throughputs of RLNC and TDMA. For a
total message length of K bits, which can be subdivided into blocks of smaller
size prior to channel coding, we obtain the channel coding rate and the number
of blocks that maximize the expected throughput of both RLNC and TDMA, and we
find that TDMA is more throughput-efficient for small message lengths K and
small q.

of an asteroid belt having a total mass less than approximately 0.05 Earth

belt extends over a wide range of radii, consistent with the absence of any

accretion-driven spin-up and subsequently evaporated its companion may harbor
orbiting asteroid mass objects. The resulting timing variations may
fundamentally limit the timing precision of some of the other millisecond

statistical stationarity that become possible when observations are conducted

mean square error for numerical integration of smooth functions defined on the

function applied to the components of a randomly scrambled digital net whose
number of components is $ds$, where the integer $d$ is the so-called
interlacing factor. In this paper, we replace the randomly scrambled digital
nets by randomly scrambled polynomial lattice point sets, which allows us to
obtain a better dependence on the dimension while still achieving the optimal
rate of convergence. Our results apply to Owen's full scrambling scheme as well
as the simplifications studied by Hickernell, Matou\v{s}ek and Owen. We
consider weighted function spaces with general weights, whose elements have
square integrable partial mixed derivatives of order up to $\alpha\ge 1$, and
derive an upper bound on the variance of the estimator for higher order
scrambled polynomial lattice rules. Employing our obtained bound as a quality
criterion, we prove that the component-by-component construction can be used to
obtain explicit constructions of good polynomial lattice point sets. By first
constructing classical polynomial lattice point sets in base $b$ and dimension
$ds$, to which we then apply the interlacing scheme of order $d$, we obtain a
construction cost of the algorithm of order $\mathcal{O}(dsmb^m)$ operations

configurations and polytopes have been studied extensively for a long time.
However, symmetries of oriented matroids, a common combinatorial abstraction of
them, are not understood well. In this paper, we aim to obtain a better
understanding of symmetries of oriented matroids. First, we put focus on
symmetries of matroids, and give a general construction that generates a
$3$-dimensional point configuration with a matroidal symmetry that cannot be
realized as a geometric symmetry. The construction is based on the observation
that every non-trivial rotation in the $2$-dimensional Euclidean space has a
unique fixed point but that there is no corresponding property for matroids.
The construction suggests that the lack of the fixed point theorem generates a
big gap between matroidal symmetries and geometric symmetries of point
configurations. Motivated by this insight, we study fixed-point properties for
symmetry groups of oriented matroids. For rotational symmetries of oriented
matroids, we prove a useful property, which corresponds to the uniqueness of
fixed points (in the rank $3$ case). Using it, we classify rotational and full
symmetry groups of simple oriented matroids of rank $3$. In addition, we define
fixed-point-admitting (FPA) property for subgroups of symmetry groups of
oriented matroids, and make classification of rotational symmetry groups with
FPA property of simple acyclic oriented matroids of rank $4$. We conjecture
that the symmetry group of every acyclic simple oriented matroid has FPA
property.

phases: 1) Using the CoF framework based on signal alignment we transform the
Gaussian network into a deterministic finite field network. 2) Using linear
precoding (over finite field) we eliminate the end-to-end interference in the
finite field domain. Further, we exploit the algebraic structure of lattices to
enhance the performance at finite SNR, such that beyond a degree of freedom
result (also achievable by other means). We can also show that Aligned PCoF
outperforms time sharing in a range of reasonably moderate SNR, with increasing
gain as SNR increases.

and a septet. The vacuum expectation value of a septet with hypercharge Y=2 is
known to preserve the electroweak rho parameter unity at the tree level.
Therefore, the septet can give significant contribution to the electroweak
symmetry breaking. Due to the mixing with the septet, the gauge coupling of the
standard-model-like Higgs boson is larger than that in the standard model. We
show the sizable VEV of the Higgs septet can be allowed under the constraint
from the electroweak precision data. The signal strengths of the Higgs boson
for the diphoton and a pair of weak gauge boson decay channels at the LHC are
enhanced, while those for the fermonic decay modes are suppressed. The mass of
additional neutral Higgs boson is also bounded by the current LHC data for the
standard model Higgs boson. We discussed the phenomenology of the multiply
charged Higgs bosons, which come from the septet.

channels with arbitrarily distributed input symbols is considered in this
paper. The precoding strategy that maximizes the mutual information along N
independent channel accesses is studied under non-causal knowledge of the
channel state and harvested energy (commonly known as offline approach). It is
shown that, at each channel use, the left singular vectors of the precoder are
equal to the eigenvectors of the Gram channel matrix. Additionally, an
expression that relates the optimal singular values of the precoder with the
energy harvesting profile through the Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) matrix
is obtained. Then, the specific situation in which the right singular vectors
of the precoder are set to the identity matrix is considered. In this scenario,
the optimal offline power allocation, named Mercury Water-Flowing, is derived
and an intuitive graphical representation is presented. Two optimal offline
algorithms to compute the Mercury Water- Flowing solution are proposed and an
exhaustive study of their computational complexity is performed. Moreover, an
online algorithm is designed, which only uses causal knowledge of the harvested
energy and channel state. Finally, the achieved mutual information is evaluated

processes in the jet of Mrk 421 through fitting the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) in different active states in the frame of a one-zone
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. After assuming two possible EEDs formed
in different acceleration models: the shock accelerated power-law with
exponential cut-off (PLC) EED and the stochastic turbulence accelerated
log-parabolic (LP) EED, we fit the observed SEDs of Mrk 421 in both low and
giant flare states by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method which
constrains the model parameters in a more efficient way. Our calculating
results indicate that (1) the PLC and LP models give comparably good fits for
the SED in low state, but the variations of model parameters from low state to
flaring can be reasonably explained only in the case of the PLC in low state;
and (2) the LP model gives better fits compared to the PLC model for the SED in
flare state, and the intra-day/night variability observed at GeV-TeV bands can
be accommodated only in the LP model. The giant flare may be attributed to the
stochastic turbulence re-acceleration of the shock accelerated electrons in low
state. Therefore, we may conclude that shock acceleration is dominant in low
state, while stochastic turbulence acceleration is dominant in flare state.
Moreover, our result shows that the extrapolated TeV spectra from the best-fit
SEDs from optical through GeV with the two EEDs are different. It should be
considered in caution when such extrapolated TeV spectra are used to constrain
extragalactic background light (EBL) models.

turbulence at high Reynolds numbers are numerically studied. In particular,
numerical experiments (with resolution up to $8192\times 8192$) provide a
Kraichnan-type turbulence spectrum $E_k\sim k^{-3}$. By means of spatial
filtration, it is found that the main contribution to the spectrum comes from
the sharp vorticity gradients in the form of quasi-shocks. Such
quasi-singularities are responsible for a strong angular dependence of the
spectrum owing to well-localized (in terms of the angle) jets with minor and/or
large overlapping. In each jet, the spectrum decreases as $k^{-3}$. The
behavior of the third-order structure function accurately agrees with Kraichnan
direct cascade concept corresponding to a constant enstrophy flux. It is shown
that the power law exponents $\zeta_n$ for higher structure functions grow more
slowly than the linear dependence of $n$, which testifies to turbulence
intermittency.

proto-planetary nebula IRAS 18276-1431 by means of two-dimensional radiative
transfer simulations of the circumstellar dust shell. The model geometry is
assumed to have a torus and an envelope. The parameters of the dust and the
dust shell are constrained by comparing the SED and NIR intensity and
polarisation data with the models. The polarisation in the envelope reaches 50
-- 60 % and is nearly constant in the H and K_S bands in the observations. This
weak wavelength dependence of the polarisation can be reproduced with a grain
size distribution function for the torus: 0.05 micron <= a with
n(a)=a^{-(p=5.5)}exp(-a/{a_c=0.3 micron}). The power index p is significantly
steeper than that for interstellar dust. Similar results have also been found
in some other PPNs and suggest that mechanisms that grind down large particles
may also have acted when the dust particles formed. The spectral opacity index
beta is found to be 0.6+/-0.5 from the millimeter fluxes. This low value
indicates the presence of large dust grains in the torus. We discuss two
possible dust models for the torus. One has a size distribution function of 1.0
micron <= a <= a_max=5,000.0 micron with n(a)=a^{-(p=2.5)} and the other is 1.0
micron <= a <= a_max=10,000.0 micron with n(a)=a^{-(p=3.5)}. The former has
beta of 0.633, but we are not able to find reasonable geometry parameters to
fit the SED in the infrared. The latter has beta of 1.12, but reproduces the
SED better over a wide wavelength range. With this dust model, the geometric
parameters are estimated as follows: the inner and outer radii are 30 AU and
1000 AU and the torus mass is 3.0 M_sun. Assuming an expansion velocity of 15
kms^{-1}, the torus formation time and mass-loss rate are found to be \sim300

birefringence which depends on the shape of the cell and intrinsic
birefringence which is brought about by the presence of the parasite. We
quantitatively measure changes in the refractive index as normal RBS become
infected by a malarial parasite. Malarial infections are found to induce
changes in the cell's refractive index whose magnitude depends on the stage of
malarial infection; such changes were quantitatively explored and found to be
large, in the range 1.2 to 3$\times10^{-2}$. Our results have implications for
the development and use of non-invasive techniques that seek to quantify
changes in cell properties induced by pathological states accompanying diseases
like malaria. From a broader prespective, information forthcoming from our

computational efforts that have a bearing on cell biology issues related to

interpretation of the variation (or shape derivative) of the Dirichlet
groundstate energy when the associated domain is perturbed. This interpretation
relies on the distribution on the boundary of a stopped random process with
Feynman-Kac weights. Practical computations require in addition the explicit
approximation of the normal derivative of the groundstate on the boundary. We
then propose to use this formulation in the case of the so-called fixed node
approximation of fermion groundstates, defined by the bottom eigenelements of
the Schr\""odinger operator of a fermionic system with Dirichlet conditions on
the nodes (the set of zeros) of an initially guessed skew-symmetric function.
We show that the shape derivative of the fixed node energy vanishes if and only
if either (i) the distribution on the nodes of the stopped random process is
symmetric; or (ii) the nodes are exactly the zeros of a skew-symmetric
eigenfunction of the operator. We propose an approximation of the shape
derivative of the fixed node energy that can be computed with a Monte-Carlo
algorithm, which can be referred to as Nodal Monte-Carlo (NMC). The latter
approximation of the shape derivative also vanishes if and only if either (i)
or (ii) holds.

paradigm in describing natural and societal complex systems. The study of
network properties, and their implications on dynamical processes, mostly focus
on locally defined quantities of nodes and edges, such as node degrees, edge
weights and --more recently-- correlations between neighboring nodes. However,
statistical methods quickly become cumbersome when dealing with many-body
properties and do not capture the precise mesoscopic structure of complex
networks. Here we introduce a novel method, based on persistent homology, to
detect particular non-local structures, akin to weighted holes within the
link-weight network fabric, which are invisible to existing methods. Their
properties divide weighted networks in two broad classes: one is characterized
by small hierarchically nested holes, while the second displays larger and
longer living inhomogeneities. These classes cannot be reduced to known local
or quasilocal network properties, because of the intrinsic non-locality of
homological properties, and thus yield a new classification built on high order
coordination patterns. Our results show that topology can provide novel
insights relevant for many-body interactions in social and spatial networks.
Moreover, this new method creates the first bridge between network theory and
algebraic topology, which will allow to import the toolset of algebraic methods
to complex systems.

composition of the interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
population in photodissociation regions (PDRs). We aim to model the spatial
evolution of the charge and hydrogenation states of PAHs in PDRs. We focus on
the specific case of the north-west (NW) PDR of NGC 7023 and also discuss the
case of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). The physical conditions in NGC
7023 NW are modelled using a state-of-the-art PDR code. We then use a new PAH
chemical evolution model that includes recent experimental data on PAHs and
describes multiphoton events. We consider a family of compact PAHs bearing up
to 96 carbon atoms. The calculated ionization ratio is in good agreement with
observations in NGC 7023 NW. Within the PDR, PAHs evolve into three major
populations: medium-sized PAHs (50<Nc<90) are normally hydrogenated, larger
PAHs (Nc>90) can be superhydrogenated, and smaller species (Nc<50) are fully
dehydrogenated. In the cavity, where the fullerene C60 was recently detected,
all the studied PAHs are found to be quickly fully dehydrogenated. PAH chemical
evolution exhibits a complex non-linear behaviour as a function of the UV
radiation field because of multiphoton events. Steady state for hydrogenation
is reached on timescales ranging from less than a year for small PAHs, up to
10000 years for large PAHs at Av=1. We identified critical reactions that need
more studies. Our new model allows us to rationalize the observational
constraints without any fitting parameter. PAHs smaller than 50 carbon atoms
are not expected to survive in the NGC 7023 NW PDR. A similar conclusion is
obtained for the diffuse ISM. Carbon clusters turn out to be end products of
PAH photodissociation, and the evolution of these clusters needs to be
investigated further to evaluate their impact on the chemical and physical
evolution of PDRs.

for each n, the number of partitions of size n avoiding all the members of S is
the same as the number of those that avoid all the members of T.
  Our goal is to classify the equivalence classes among two-element pattern
sets of several general types. First, we focus on pairs of patterns
{\sigma,\tau}, where \sigma\ is a pattern of size three with at least two
distinct symbols and \tau\ is an arbitrary pattern of size k that avoids
\sigma. We show that pattern-pairs of this type determine a small number of
equivalence classes; in particular, the classes have on average exponential
size in k. We provide a (sub-exponential) upper bound for the number of
equivalence classes, and provide an explicit formula for the generating
function of all such avoidance classes, showing that in all cases this
generating function is rational.
  Next, we study partitions avoiding a pair of patterns of the form
{1212,\tau}, where \tau\ is an arbitrary pattern. Note that partitions avoiding
1212 are exactly the non-crossing partitions. We provide several general
equivalence criteria for pattern pairs of this type, and show that these
criteria account for all the equivalences observed when \tau\ has size at most
six.

comparison with previous ATCA observations at 18 and 36 GHz highlights higher
expansion velocities of the remnant eastern side. The 18-44 GHz spectral index

suggests slightly steeper values at the brightest sites on the eastern lobe,

X-ray and H$\alpha$ observations. Unlike the H$\alpha$ emission, both the radio

index align and partially overlap with the optically-visible ejecta. Simple
free-free absorption models suggest that emission from a pulsar wind nebula or
a compact source inside the remnant may now be detectable at high frequencies,

manifests as clearly defined bunches of charge with a regular size and

range. In this computational study it is demonstrated that, for a range of
parameters, conducive to generating THz frequency oscillations, the frequency
is dependant only on the cold cathode electric field and on the emitter area.
For a planar micro-diode of given dimension, the modulation frequency can be
easily tuned simply by varying the applied potential. Simulations of the
microdiode are done for 84 different combinations of emitter area, applied
voltage and gap spacing, using a molecular dynamics based code with exact
Coulomb interaction between all electrons in the vacuum gap, which is of the
order 100. It is found, for a fixed emitter area, that the frequency of the

described by a simple power law. It is also found that, for a fixed value of
the electric field, the frequency increases with diminishing size of the
emitting spot on the cathode. Some observations are made on the spectral
quality, and how it is affected by the gap spacing in the diode and the initial

${\mathrm cr^{(c)}$, of a random set partition. We prove that, for $k\leq
n/(2\,\log n)$ (resp., ${k=o(\sqrt{n})}$), the distribution of the parameter
${\mathrm cr^{(\ell)}$ (resp., ${\mathrm cr^{(c)}$) taken over partitions of
$[n]:=\{1,2,...,n\}$ into $k$ blocks is, after standardization, asymptotically
Gaussian as $n$ tends to infinity. We give exact and asymptotic formulas for
the variance of the distribution of the parameter ${\mathrm cr^{(\ell)}$ from
which we deduce that the distribution of ${\mathrm cr^{(\ell)}$ and ${\mathrm
cr^{(c)}$ taken over all partitions of $[n]$ is concentrated around its mean.
The proof of these results relies on a standard analysis of generating
functions associated with the parameter ${\mathrm cr^{(\ell)}$ obtained in
earlier work of Stanton, Zeng and the author. We also determine the maximum
values of the parameters ${\mathrm cr^{(\ell)}$ and ${\mathrm cr^{(c)}$.

the temperature anisotropies generated on the Cosmic Microwave Background
radiation. We refine our previous estimates of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect by introducing a non-polytropic equation of state to model the
temperature distribution of the shock heated gas derived from
temperature-density phase diagrams of different hydrodynamical simulations.
Depending on the specific model, the Comptonization parameter varies in the
range $10^{-7}\le y_c \le 2\times 10^{-6}$, compatible with the FIRAS upper
limit. This amplitude is in agreement with a simple toy model constructed to
estimate the average effect induced by filaments of ionized gas. Using the
log-normal probability density function we calculate the correlation function
and the power spectrum of the temperature anisotropies generated by the WHIM
filaments. For a wide range of the parameter space, the maximum amplitude of
the radiation power spectrum is $(\ell+1)\ell C_{\ell}/2\pi =0.7-70(\mu K)^2$
at $\ell \approx 200-500$. This amplitude scales with baryon density, Hubble
constant and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum $\sigma_8$ as
$[(\ell+1)\ell C_\ell]_{\mathrm{max}}/2\pi \propto \sigma_8^{2.6}(\Omega_b

henceforth CBS). The sample is one of the largest well defined samples in the
low power regime with a total of 130 sources of which 55 satisfy the
'classical' optical BL Lac selection criteria, and the rest have
indistinguishable radio properties. The primary goal of this study is to
establish the Radio Luminosity Function (RLF) on firm statistical ground at low
radio luminosities where previous samples have not been able to investigate.
The gain of taking a peek at lower powers is the possibility to search for the
flattening of the LF which is a feature predicted by the beaming model but
which has remained elusive to observational confirmation. In this study we
extend for the first time the BL Lac RLF down to very low radio powers ~10^22
W/Hz, ie, two orders of magnitude below the RLF currently available in the
literature. In the process we confirm the importance of adopting a broader, and
more physically meaningful set of classification criteria to avoid the
systematic missing of low luminosity BL Lacs. Thanks to the good statistics we
confirm the existence of weak but significant positive cosmological evolution
for the BL Lac population, and we detect, for the first time the flattening of
the RLF at ~10^25 W/Hz in agreement with the predictions of the beaming model.

Data ban studies, geography, transportation and territory management. In
network sciences mobility studies have become popular in the past few years,
especially using mobile phone location data. For preserving the customer
privacy, datasets furnished by telecom operators are anonymized. At the same
time, the large size of datasets often makes the task of calculating all
observed trajectories very difficult and time-consuming. One solution could be
to sample users. However, the fact of not having information about the mobile
user makes the sampling delicate. Some researchers select randomly a sample of
users from their dataset. Others try to optimize this method, for example,
taking into account only users with a certain number or frequency of locations
recorded. At the first glance, the second choice seems to be more efficient:
having more individual traces makes the analysis more precise. However, the
most frequently used CDR data (Call Detail Records) have location generated
only at the moment of communication (call, SMS, data connection). Due to this
fact, users mobility patterns cannot be precisely built upon their
communication patterns. Hence, these data have evident short-comings both in
terms of spatial and temporal scale. In this paper we propose to estimate the
correlation between the users communication and mo- bility in order to better
assess the bias of frequency based sampling. Using technical GSM network data
(including communication but also independent mobility records), we will
analyze the relationship between communication and mobility patterns.

gamma-ray Cherenkov telescopes with a Davies-Cotton reflector. For the design
of such telescopes, usually physics constrains the field-of-view, while the
photo-sensor size is defined by limited options. Including the effect of
light-concentrators in front of the photo sensor, it is demonstrated that these
constraints are enough to mutually constrain all other design parameters. The
dependability of the various design parameters naturally arises once a
relationship between the value of the point-spread functions at the edge of the
field-of-view and the pixel field-of-view is introduced. To be able to include
this constraint into a system of equations, an analytical description for the
point-spread function of a tessellated Davies-Cotton reflector is derived from
Taylor developments and ray-tracing simulations. Including higher order terms
renders the result precise on the percent level.
  Design curves are provided within the typical phase space of Cherenkov
telescopes. The impact of all design parameters on the overall design is
discussed. Allowing an immediate comparison of several options with identical
physics performance allows the determination of the most cost efficient
solution. Emphasize is given on the possible application of solid light
concentrators with their typically about two times better concentration
allowing the use of small photo sensors such as Geiger-mode avalanche photo
diodes. This is discussed in more details in the context of possible design
options for the Cherenkov Telescope Array. In particular, a solution for a
60\,mm(^2) photo sensor with hollow cone is compared to a 36\,mm(^2) with solid
cone.

fitness costs are absent, then the use of the high-risk fungicide in a mixture
selects for resistance and the fungicide eventually becomes nonfunctional. If

crystalline substrates (a-plane sapphire, MgO(100), Si(111)). The results are
compared to the magnetic properties of Co and of Co$_{2}$MnGe single films
lying on sapphire substrates. X-rays diffraction always shows a (110)
orientation of the Co$_{2}$MnGe films. Structural observations obtained by high
resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed the high quality of the
TMJ grown on sapphire. Our vibrating sample magnetometry measurements reveal
in-plane anisotropy only in samples grown on a sapphire substrate. Depending on
the substrate, the ferromagnetic resonance spectra of the TMJs, studied by the
microstrip technique, show one or two pseudo-uniform modes. In the case of MgO
and of Si substrates only one mode is observed: it is described by magnetic
parameters (g-factor, effective magnetization, in-plane magnetic anisotropy)
derived in the frame of a simple expression of the magnetic energy density;
these parameters are practically identical to those obtained for the Co single
film. With a sapphire substrate two modes are present: one of them does not
appreciably differ from the observed mode in the Co single film while the other
one is similar to the mode appearing in the Co$_{2}$MnGe single film: their
magnetic parameters can thus be determined independently, using a classical
model for the energy density in the absence of interlayer exchange coupling.

is protecting them from sources of decoherence. This can be addressed, to
varying degrees, by improving material purity or isotopic composition for
example, or active error correction methods such as dynamic decoupling, or even
combinations of the two. However, a powerful method applied to trapped ions in
the context of frequency standards and atomic clocks, is the use of particular
spin transitions which are inherently robust to external perturbations. Here we
show that such `clock transitions' (CTs) can be observed for electron spins in
the solid state, in particular using bismuth donors in silicon. This leads to
dramatic enhancements in the electron spin coherence time, exceeding seconds.
We find that electron spin qubits based on CTs become less sensitive to the
local magnetic environment, including the presence of 29Si nuclear spins as
found in natural silicon. We expect the use of such CTs will be of additional
importance for donor spins in future devices, mitigating the effects of
magnetic or electric field noise arising from nearby interfaces.

not preserve termination. This yields complexity bounds for the reachability,
(place) boundedness and coverability problems on {\omega}PN. We provide a
practical algorithm to compute a coverability set of the {\omega}PN and to
decide termination by adapting the classical Karp and Miller tree construction.
We also adapt the Rackoff technique to {\omega}PN, to obtain the exact

set of web diagrams. The diagrams of a web world are generalizations of graphs,
and each is built on the same underlying graph. Instead of ordinary vertices
the diagrams have pegs, and edges incident to a peg have different heights on
the peg. The web world of a web diagram is the set of all web diagrams that
result from permuting the order in which endpoints of edges appear on a peg.
The motivation comes from particle physics, where web diagrams arise as
particular types of Feynman diagrams describing scattering amplitudes in
non-Abelian gauge (Yang-Mills) theories. To each web world we associate two
matrices called the web-colouring matrix and web-mixing matrix. The entries of
these matrices are indexed by ordered pairs of web diagrams (D_1,D_2), and are
computed from those colourings of the edges of D_1 that yield D_2 under a
transformation determined by each colouring.
  We show that colourings of a web diagram (whose constituent indecomposable
diagrams are all unique) that lead to a reconstruction of the diagram are
equivalent to order-preserving mappings of certain partially ordered sets
(posets) that may be constructed from the web diagrams. For web worlds whose
web graphs have all edge labels equal to 1, the diagonal entries of web-mixing
and web-colouring matrices are obtained by summing certain polynomials
determined by the descents in permutations in the Jordan-Holder set of all
linear extensions of the associated poset. We derive tri-variate generating
generating functions for the number of web worlds according to three statistics
and enumerate the number of different web diagrams in a web world. Three
special web worlds are examined in great detail, and the traces of the
web-mixing matrices calculated in each case.

coherent detection and bucket detection, which can correspond to classical
holography using a point source, a plane-wave coherent source and a spatially

two-photon holography in the point detection regime is equivalent to the

surface. Let L be a nef line-bundle on X, such that the 2n-th power of c_1(L)
vanishes and c_1(L) is primitive. Assume that the two dimensional subspace
H^{2,0}(X) + H^{0,2}(X), of the second cohomology of X with complex
coefficients, intersects trivially the integral cohomology. We prove that the
linear system of L is base point free and it induces a Lagrangian fibration on
X. In particular, the line-bundle L is effective. A determination of the
semi-group of effective divisor classes on X follows, when X is projective. For
a generic such pair (X,L), not necessarily projective, we show that X is
bimeromorphic to a Tate-Shafarevich twist of a moduli space of stable torsion
sheaves, each with pure one dimensional support, on a projective K3 surface.

started in August 2007. In particular, we focus on the fixed income market and
we analyse the most relevant empirical evidences regarding the divergence of
the existing basis between interbank rates with different tenor, such as Libor
and OIS. We also discuss a qualitative explanation of these effects based on
the consideration of credit and liquidity variables. Then, we focus our
attention on the diffusion of collateral agreements among OTC derivatives
market counterparties, and on the consequent change of paradigm for pricing
derivatives. We illustrate the main qualitative features of the new market
practice, called CSA discounting, and we point out the most relevant issues for
market players associated to its adoption.

propagation, are particularly powerful in infinite dimensional problems such as
models involving stochastic analysis encountered in finance or physics, cf.
[5]. Now, coming back to the finite dimensional case, these methods give a new
light on the very classical concept of 'numerical approximation' and suggest
changes in the habits. We show that for some kinds of approximations only an
Ito-like second order differential calculus is relevant to describe and
propagate numerical errors through a mathematical model. We call these
situations strongly stochastic. The main point of this work is an argument
based on the arbitrary functions principle of Poincar\'e-Hopf showing that the
errors due to measurements with graduated instruments are strongly stochastic.
Eventually we discuss the consequences of this phenomenon on the specification
of an approximate numerical result.

Copenhagen measurement protocol is equivalent to the two-system von Neumann
scheme with the memory filling up the system with negative information similar
to the Dirac sea of negative energy. After equating the two quantum measurement
protocols, we then apply this equivalence to the black hole radiation. That is,
the black hole evaporation corresponds to the quantum measurement process and
the two evaporation approaches, the observable-based single-system and the
two-system entanglement-based protocols, can be made equivalent using quantum
memory. In particular, the measurement choice, \theta, with the memory state
inside the horizon in the entanglement-based scheme is shown to correspond to
the observable of the measurement choice, \theta, outside the horizon in the
single-system protocol, that is, O_{\theta}^{out} = Q_{\theta}^{in}. This
indicates that the black hole as quantum memory is filling up with negative
information outside the horizon, and its entropy corresponds to the logarithm
of a number of equally probable measurement choices. This shows that the black
hole radiation is no different than ordinary quantum theory.

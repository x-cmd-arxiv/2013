application (and a severe numerical test), we investigate the late-time decays
of electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations at the horizon and future
null infinity by means of 2+1 evolutions. As initial data we consider four
combinations of (non-)stationary and (non-)compact-support initial data with a
pure spin-weighted spherical harmonic profile. We present an extensive study of
late time decays of axisymmetric perturbations. We verify the power-law decay
rates predicted analytically, together with a certain ""splitting"" behaviour of

perturbations. In particular, our approach allows to study the behaviour of the
late time decays of gravitational fields for nearly extremal and extremal black

quasi-normal-mode phase. For extremal rotation the field at future null
infinity shows an oscillatory behaviour decaying as the inverse power of time,

comparison, another model which exactly follows the method of Sakharov and Lim
(J. Am. Chem. Soc., 127, 13, 2005) has been discussed also. We show that,
associated with proper van der Waals (vdW) parameters, our model not only
obtains the reasonable coordinating configuration of zinc binding site, but
also retains the global stabilization, especially the N-terminal region, of the

reasonable solvent exposures of hydrophobic/hydrophilic residues regarding
zinc-induced AB aggregation.

between scales in simulations of stellar convective dynamos. The full triadic
transfer functions are computed thanks to analytical coupling relations of
spherical harmonics based on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The method is
applied to mean field $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo models as benchmark tests. From the
physical standpoint, the decomposition of the dynamo field into primary and
secondary dynamo families proves very instructive in the $\alpha\Omega$ case.
The same method is then applied to a fully turbulent dynamo in a solar
convection zone, modeled with the 3D MHD ASH code. The initial growth of the
magnetic energy spectrum is shown to be non-local. It mainly reproduces the
kinetic energy spectrum of convection at intermediate scales. During the
saturation phase, two kinds of direct magnetic energy cascades are observed in
regions encompassing the smallest scales involved in the simulation. The first
cascade is obtained through the shearing of magnetic field by the large scale
differential rotation that effectively cascades magnetic energy. The second is
a generalized cascade that involves a range of local magnetic and velocity
scales. Non-local transfers appear to be significant, such that the net
transfers cannot be reduced to the dynamics of a small set of modes. The
saturation of the large scale axisymmetric dipole and quadrupole are detailed.
In particular, the dipole is saturated by a non-local interaction involving the
most energetic scale of the magnetic energy spectrum, which points out the
importance of the magnetic Prandtl number for large-scale dynamos.

interaction prediction, the accuracy of the state-of-the-art algorithms are
still far from satisfactory. Researchers have proposed increasingly complex
energy models and improved parameter estimation methods in anticipation of
endowing their methods with enough power to solve the problem. The output has
disappointingly been only modest improvements, not matching the expectations.
Even recent massively featured machine learning approaches were not able to
break the barrier. In this paper, we introduce the notion of learnability of
the parameters of an energy model as a measure of its inherent capability. We
say that the parameters of an energy model are learnable iff there exists at
least one set of such parameters that renders every known RNA structure to date
the minimum free energy structure. We derive a necessary condition for the
learnability and give a dynamic programming algorithm to assess it. Our
algorithm computes the convex hull of the feature vectors of all feasible
structures in the ensemble of a given input sequence. Interestingly, that
convex hull coincides with the Newton polytope of the partition function as a
polynomial in energy parameters. We demonstrated the application of our theory
to a simple energy model consisting of a weighted count of A-U and C-G base
pairs. Our results show that this simple energy model satisfies the necessary
condition for less than one third of the input unpseudoknotted
sequence-structure pairs chosen from the RNA STRAND v2.0 database. For another
one third, the necessary condition is barely violated, which suggests that
augmenting this simple energy model with more features such as the Turner loops
may solve the problem. The necessary condition is severely violated for 8%,
which provides a small set of hard cases that require further investigation.

estimate the Galactic abundance gradients. The column densities of the neutral
gas species are in agreement with those found in the literature. Solids are a

estimates of abundance gradients and predictions of local interstellar
abundances are in agreement with those measured at longer wavelengths. Our work

instance, on a large scale the ISM appears to be chemically homogeneous showing
similar gas ionization ratios and dust mixtures. The agreement between the

investigated over a large temperature range (25^{\circ}C to 700^{\circ}C).
High-energy X-ray tomography was used to reveal the percolation of the hard
titanium carbide phase through the composite. Using a polycrystal approach for
a two-phase material, finite element simulations were performed on a real 3D
aggregate of the material. The 3D microstructure, used as starting
configuration for the predictions, was obtained by serial-sectioning in a dual
beam Focused Ion Beam (FIB)-Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) coupled to an
Electron Back Scattering Diffraction system (3D EBSD, EBSD tomography). The 3D
aggregate consists of a molybdenum matrix and a percolating TiC skeleton. As
most BCC metals, the molybdenum matrix phase is characterized by a change in
the plasticity mechanisms with temperature. We used a polycrystal model for the
BCC material, which was extended to two phases (TiC and Mo). The model
parameters of the matrix were determined from experiments on pure molydenum.
For all temperatures investigated, the TiC particles were considered as
brittle. Gradual damage of the TiC particles was treated, based on an
accumulative failure law that is approximated by an evolution of the apparent
particle elastic stiffness. The model enabled us to determine the evolution of
the local mechanical fields with deformation and temperature. We showed that a
3D aggregate representing the actual microstructure of the composite is
required to understand the local and global mechanical properties of the
studied composite.

tests were carried out on real size tubular specimens under various thermal

micro-hardness tests performed at and under the inner surface of the specimen
before testing, revealed residual internal stresses and a large dislocation
microstructure gradient in correlation with hardening gradients due to

into an elasto-visco-plastic model in order to determine the stress and strain
fields at the inner surface. The temperature evolution on the inner surface of
the tubular specimen was first computed via a thermo-elastic model and then
used for our thermo-mechanical simulations. Identification of the
thermo-mechanical model parameters was based on the experimental stabilized
cyclic tension-compression tests performed at 20^{\circ}C and 300^{\circ}C. A
good agreement was obtained between numerical stabilized traction-compression
cycle curves (with and without pre-straining) and experimental ones. This 3
dimensional simulation gave access to the evolution of the axial and tangential
internal stresses and local strains during the tests. Numerical results showed:
a decreasing of the tangential stress and stabilization after 40 cycles,
whereas the axial stress showed weaker decreasing with the number of cycles.
The results also pointed out a ratcheting and a slightly non proportional
loading at the inner surface. The computed mean stress and strain values of the
stabilized cycle being far from the initial ones, they could be used to get the
safety margins of standard design related to fatigue, as well as to get
accurate loading conditions needed for the use of more advanced fatigue

spectral fluctuations of the redshifted HI 21cm signal. This signal is weaker
by several orders of magnitude than the astrophysical foreground signals and
hence, in order to achieve this, very long integrations, accurate calibration
for stations and ionosphere and reliable foreground removal are essential. One
of the prospective observing windows for the LOFAR EoR project will be centered
at the North Celestial Pole (NCP). We present results from observations of the
NCP window using the LOFAR highband antenna (HBA) array in the frequency range
115 MHz to 163 MHz. The data were obtained in April 2011 during the
commissioning phase of LOFAR. We used baselines up to about 30 km. With about 3
nights, of 6 hours each, effective integration we have achieved a noise level
of about 100 microJy/PSF in the NCP window. Close to the NCP, the noise level
increases to about 180 microJy/PSF, mainly due to additional contamination from
unsubtracted nearby sources. We estimate that in our best night, we have
reached a noise level only a factor of 1.4 above the thermal limit set by the
noise from our Galaxy and the receivers. Our continuum images are several times
deeper than have been achieved previously using the WSRT and GMRT arrays. We
derive an analytical explanation for the excess noise that we believe to be
mainly due to sources at large angular separation from the NCP.

it must prevent the dispersion of the radioactive elements, which are formed by
fission inside the UO2 pellets filling the clad. We focus here on internal
corrosion that occurs when the clad is in tight contact with the UO2 pellet. In
this situation, with temperature of 400^{\circ}C on the internal surface of the
clad, a layer of oxidised Zircaloy is formed with a thickness ranging from 5 to
15 $\mu$m. In this paper, we will underline the specific behaviour of this
internal corrosion layer compared to wet corrosion of Zircaloy. Simulations
will underline the differences of stress field and their influences on
corresponding dissolved oxygen profiles. The reasons for these differences will
be discussed as function of the mechanical state at inner surface of the clad
which is highly compressed. Differences between mechanical conditions generated
by an inner or outer corrosion of the clad are studied and their influences on
the diffusion phenomena are highlighted.

avalanche distribution is scale invariant. In this work we study the surface
dynamics by looking at avalanche distributions using Finite-size Scaling

the same universality for the cases with and without a wall for an odd number

even number of avalanches released. We provide new conjecture for the
probability distribution of avalanches with a wall obtained by using exact
diagonalization of small lattices and Monte-Carlo simulations.

$O(b.|P_{sim}|.|{\rightarrow}|)$ time, with $b$ a branching factor generally

distributions that typically arise, in a Bayesian framework, when dealing with
signal decomposition problems with an unknown number of components. Such
posterior distributions are defined over union of subspaces of differing
dimensionality and can be sampled from using modern Monte Carlo techniques, for
instance the increasingly popular RJ-MCMC method. No generic approach is
available, however, to summarize the resulting variable-dimensional samples and
extract from them component-specific parameters. We propose a novel approach,
named Variable-dimensional Approximate Posterior for Relabeling and Summarizing
(VAPoRS), to this problem, which consists in approximating the posterior
distribution of interest by a ""simple""---but still
variable-dimensional---parametric distribution. The distance between the two
distributions is measured using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and a
Stochastic EM-type algorithm, driven by the RJ-MCMC sampler, is proposed to
estimate the parameters. Two signal decomposition problems are considered, to
show the capability of VAPoRS both for relabeling and for summarizing variable
dimensional posterior distributions: the classical problem of detecting and
estimating sinusoids in white Gaussian noise on the one hand, and a particle
counting problem motivated by the Pierre Auger project in astrophysics on the
other hand.

to destruction of H2D+ at T ~ 20 K and the evaporation of CO off dust grains at
the same temperature. However, the abundance offsets of 1000 AU between the two
species are not reproduced by chemical models, including a model that follows
the infall of the protostellar envelope. The average abundance ratios of N2D+

undergoes nearly reversible deformation over about $10^4$ cycles. Upon
increasing strain amplitude, the transition to the diffusive regime occurs at
shorter time intervals and the relaxation process involves intermittent bursts

second result is that if \pi is regular and \rho crystalline, then for

decomposition type of \rho is the same as the isobaric type of \pi. A
consequence is that \rho is irreducible when \pi is cuspidal (and regular
algebraic), which has also been proved by F. Calegari and T. Gee, in fact with
no hypothesis on p. The third and final result, using Taylor's potential
modularity theorem, is that given a pair (\sigma, \sigma') of odd,
2-dimensional p-adic representations of the same weight and distinct Hodge-Tate
types, such that their direct sum is automorphic, the dimension of the
G_F-invariants of the tensor product \eta of the dual of \sigma with \sigma'
equals, for large p, the order of pole at s=1 of the L-function of \eta (with
the bad factors removed). This is as predicted by the Tate conjecture when

The broad range in mass is due primarily to the unknown age of the object.
Since the high tangential velocity of the object, 51$\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$, is
characteristic of an old disk population, a plausible age range of 2-4 Gyr
leads to a mass range of 3-6 M$_{Jup}$ based on fits to the (highly uncertain)
COND evolutionary models. The range in temperature is due to the fact that no
single model adequately represents the 1-5 $\mu$m spectral energy distribution
(SED) of the source, failing by factors of up to 5 at either the short or long
wavelength portions of the spectral energy distribution. The appearance of this
very cold object may be affected by non-equilibrium chemistry or low
temperature condensates forming clouds, two atmospheric processes that are
known to be important in brown dwarf atmospheres but have proven difficult to
model. Finally, we argue that there would have to be a very steep upturn in the
number density of late type Y-dwarfs to account for the putative population of

interferometry provides an unprecedented experimental probe by entangling two

decoherence collapses both photons to unpredictable but definite outcomes; and
the two-photon MS continues evolving coherently. Thus, contrary to common

definite outcomes, two-photon interferometry verifies them to be not only
consistent with, but actually a prediction of, the other principles.
Nonlocality is the key to understanding this. As a consequence of nonlocality,
the states we actually observe are the local states. These actually-observed
local states collapse, while the global MS, which can be ""observed"" only after
the fact by collecting coincidence data from both subsystems, continues its

emission in every case, with a mean diameter of 28 kpc. These nebulae are
nearly perfectly round. The regular morphologies of nebulae around RQ quasars
are in striking contrast with lumpy or elongated nebulae seen around radio
galaxies at low and high redshifts. We present the uniformly measured
size-luminosity relationship of [O III] nebulae around Seyfert 2 galaxies and
type 2 quasars spanning 6 orders of magnitude in luminosity and confirm the
flat slope of the correlation (R ~ L^{0.25+/-0.02}). We find a universal
behavior of the [O III]/H-beta ratio in our entire RQ quasar sample: it
persists at a constant value (~10) in the central regions, until reaching a
""break"" isophotal radius ranging from 4 to 11 kpc where it starts to decrease.
We propose a model of clumpy nebulae in which clouds that produce line emission
transition from being ionization-bounded at small distances from the quasar to
being matter-bounded in the outer parts of the nebula, which qualitatively
explains the observed line ratio and surface brightness profiles. It is
striking that we see such smooth and round large-scale gas nebulosities in this

MeV<E<100 GeV) \gamma-ray radiation which could originate from the cumulative
emission of the numerous millisecond pulsars (msPSRs) in the clusters' cores or
from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of relativistic leptons accelerated in the
GC environment. These stellar clusters could also constitute a new class of
sources in the very-high-energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) \gamma-ray regime, judging
from the recent detection of a signal from the direction of Terzan 5 with the
H.E.S.S. telescope array.
  We searched for point-like and extended VHE \gamma-ray emission from 15 GCs
serendipitously covered by H.E.S.S observations and also performed a stacking
analysis combining the data from all GCs to investigate the hypothesis of a
population of faint emitters. Assuming IC emission as the origin of the VHE
\gamma-ray signal from the direction of Terzan 5, we calculated the expected
\gamma-ray flux from each of the 15 GCs, based on their number of millisecond
pulsars, their optical brightness and the energy density of background photon
fields.
  We did not detect significant VHE \gamma-ray emission from any of the 15 GCs
in either of the two analyses. Given the uncertainties related to the parameter
determinations, the obtained flux upper limits allow to rule out the simple
IC/msPSR scaling model for NGC 6388 and NGC 7078. The upper limits derived from
the stacking analyses are factors between 2 and 50 below the flux predicted by
the simple leptonic scaling model, depending on the assumed source extent and
the dominant target photon fields. Therefore, Terzan 5 still remains
exceptional among all GCs, as the VHE \gamma-ray emission either arises from
extra-ordinarily efficient leptonic processes, or from a recent catastrophic
event, or is even unrelated to the GC itself.

structure and evolution of the universe and its constituents. Galaxies can grow
their stellar mass by accretion of halo or intergalactic gas clouds, or by
merging with smaller or similar mass galaxies. The gas available translates
into a rate of star formation, which controls the generation of metals in the
universe. The spatially resolved history of their stellar mass assembly has not
been obtained so far for any given galaxy beyond the Local Group. Here we
demonstrate how massive galaxies grow their stellar mass inside-out. We report
the results from the analysis of the first 105 galaxies of the largest to date
three-dimensional spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the local universe
(CALIFA). We apply the fossil record method of stellar population spectral
synthesis to recover the spatially and time resolved star formation history of
each galaxy. We show, for the first time, that the signal of downsizing is
spatially preserved, with both inner and outer regions growing faster for more
massive galaxies. Further, we show that the relative growth rate of the
spheroidal component, nucleus and inner galaxy, that happened 5-7 Gyr ago,
shows a maximum at a critical stellar mass ~10^10 Msun. We also find that
galaxies less massive than ~10^10 Msun show a transition to outside-in growth,
thus connecting with results from resolved studies of the growth of low mass
galaxies.

collected high-resolution circular polarisation observations of II Peg using
the SOFIN spectropolarimeter at the Nordic Optical Telescope. These data cover
12 epochs spread over 7 years. A multi-line diagnostic technique in combination
with a new ZDI code is applied to interpret these observations. Magnetic
inversions using these data reveals evolving magnetic fields with typical local
strengths of 0.5-1.0 kG and complex topologies. Despite using a self-consistent
magnetic and temperature mapping technique, we do not find a clear correlation
between magnetic and temperature features in the ZDI maps. Neither do we
confirm the presence of persistent azimuthal field rings found in other RS CVn

significant evolution of both the surface magnetic field structure and the
extended magnetospheric field geometry. From 2004 to 2010 the total field
energy drastically declined and the field became less axisymmetric. This also
coincided with the transition from predominantly poloidal to mainly toroidal
field topology. A qualitative comparison of the ZDI maps of II Peg with the
prediction of dynamo theory suggests that the magnetic field in this star is
produced mainly by the turbulent alpha^2 dynamo rather than the solar
alphaOmega dynamo. Our results do not show a clear active longitude system, nor
is there an evidence of the presence of an azimuthal dynamo wave.

cluster- and group-sized halos, extracted from $\Lambda$CDM cosmological N-body
and hydrodynamic simulations, and their velocity dispersions, at different
redshifts from $z=2$ to $z=0$. The main aim of this analysis is to understand
how the implementation of baryonic physics in simulations affects such
relation, i.e. to what extent the use of the velocity dispersion as a proxy for
cluster mass determination is hampered by the imperfect knowledge of the
baryonic physics. In our analysis we use several sets of simulations with
different physics implemented. Velocity dispersions are determined using three
different tracers, DM particles, subhalos, and galaxies.
  We confirm that DM particles trace a relation that is fully consistent with
the theoretical expectations based on the virial theorem and with previous
results presented in the literature. On the other hand, subhalos and galaxies
trace steeper relations, and with larger values of the normalization. Such
relations imply that galaxies and subhalos have a $\sim10$ per cent velocity
bias relative to the DM particles, which can be either positive or negative,
depending on halo mass, redshift and physics implemented in the simulation.
  We explain these differences as due to dynamical processes, namely dynamical
friction and tidal disruption, acting on substructures and galaxies, but not on
DM particles. These processes appear to be more or less effective, depending on
the halo masses and the importance of baryon cooling, and may create a
non-trivial dependence of the velocity bias and the $\soneD$--$\Mtwo$ relation
on the tracer, the halo mass and its redshift.
  These results are relevant in view of the application of velocity dispersion
as a proxy for cluster masses in ongoing and future large redshift surveys.

trigger bar formation. For fainter galaxies the interactions become strong
enough to heat up the disks inhibiting bar formation and even destroying the

different luminosity ranges of the galaxy samples studied so far.

that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z=1, although we
do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a ~30% increase in
the number density of ~10^10 Msun galaxies since z~0.6, and a <10% change in
the number density of all >10^11 Msun galaxies since z~1. Dividing the sample
into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific
star-formation rate, we find that the number density of ~10^10 Msun

increases steeply towards low redshift, by a factor of ~2-3 since z~0.6, while
the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since
z~1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are
quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the
stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around ~10^10.8

We start with measurements of the stellar mass function of galaxies (from the

probability of a galaxy hosting an AGN as a function of specific accretion
rate. Our model is based on measurements indicating that the specific accretion
rate distribution is a universal function across a wide range of host stellar
mass with slope gamma_1 = -0.65 and an overall normalization that evolves with
redshift. We test several simple assumptions to extend this model to high
specific accretion rates (beyond the measurements) and compare the predictions
for the XLF with the observed data. We find good agreement with a model that
allows for a break in the specific accretion rate distribution at a point
corresponding to the Eddington limit, a steep power-law tail to super-Eddington
ratios with slope gamma_2 = -2.1 +0.3 -0.5, and a scatter of 0.38 dex in the
scaling between black hole and host stellar mass. Our results show that samples
of low luminosity AGNs are dominated by moderately massive galaxies (M* ~
10^{10-11} M_sun) growing with a wide range of accretion rates due to the shape
of the galaxy stellar mass function rather than a preference for AGN activity
at a particular stellar mass. Luminous AGNs may be a severely skewed population
with elevated black hole masses relative to their host galaxies and in rare
phases of rapid accretion.

perspectives: the microscopic perspective of a tight-binding model and an
ab-initio calculation on bilayer, and the perspective of symmetry protected
topological (SPT) states for general multi-layer. We show that a AB-BA bilayer
tilt boundary supports gapless kink states that are undeterred by strain
concentrated at the boundary. Further, we establish the kink states as concrete
examples of edge states of {\it time-reversal symmetric} ${\mathbb Z}$-type
SPT, protected by no valley mixing, electron number conservation, and time
reversal $T$ symmetries. This allows us to discuss possible phase transitions
upon symmetry changes from the SPT perspective. Recent experimental
observations of a network of such tilt boundaries suggest that transport
through these novel topological kink states might explain the long standing
puzzle of sub-gap conductance. Further, recent observation of gap closing and
re-opening in gated bi-layer might be the first example of a transition between
two distinct SPT's: QVH and LAF.

compatible with local Lorentz invariance. One way to address this issue is to
view gravity as a gauge theory on observer space, rather than spacetime. In a
Lorentz covariant theory observer space is the space of unit future-directed
timelike vectors; picking such a vector locally breaks the symmetry to a
subgroup SO(D) of SO(D,1), so that on observer space the local symmetry group
is SO(D). Observer space geometries naturally describe any gravitational theory
that only assumes local invariance under SO(D). Here we construct
nonrelativistic observer spaces for gravity with a fixed foliation, applicable
to preferred foliation theories such as Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Different
Horava-Lifshitz observers at a point are related by a change in the shift
vector, leaving the preferred foliation invariant. Gravity is formulated on a
non-relativistic frame bundle with structure group ISO(D); the shift vector
acts as a symmetry breaking field breaking ISO(D) symmetry spontaneously to
SO(D). A natural torsion-free connection is constructed, including the usual
SO(D,1) connection of relativistic gravity plus terms depending on derivatives
of the shift vector. This observer space geometry provides a novel geometric
framework for the study of preferred foliation theories.

of silicate dust to melting temperatures. Some highly refractory grains (Type B
calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions, CAIs) also show signs of transient heating. A
similar process may occur in other protoplanetary disks, as evidenced by
observations of spectra characteristic of crystalline silicates. One possible
environment for this process is the turbulent magnetohydrodynamic flow thought
to drive accretion in these disks. Such flows generally form thin current
sheets, which are sites of magnetic reconnection, and dissipate the magnetic
fields amplified by a disk dynamo. We suggest that it is possible to heat
precursor grains for chondrules and other high-temperature minerals in current
sheets that have been concentrated by our recently described short-circuit
instability. We extend our work on this process by including the effects of
radiative cooling, taking into account the temperature dependence of the
opacity; and by examining current sheet geometry in three-dimensional, global
models of magnetorotational instability. We find that temperatures above 1600 K
can be reached for favorable parameters that match the ideal global models.
This mechanism could provide an efficient means of tapping the gravitational
potential energy of the protoplanetary disk to heat grains strongly enough to
form high-temperature minerals. The volume-filling nature of turbulent magnetic
reconnection is compatible with constraints from chondrule-matrix
complementarity, chondrule-chondrule complementarity, the occurrence of igneous
rims, and compound chondrules. The same short-circuit mechanism may perform
other high-temperature mineral processing in protoplanetary disks such as the
production of crystalline silicates and CAIs.

received considerable attention in recent years. Moreover, cooperation with

confidential messages from source to legitimate receiver in the presence of an

assuming the relay is subject to a peak power constraint. To this end, an
achievable secrecy rate for Gaussian input is evaluated through solving a
non-convex optimization problem. Then, it is proved that any rates greater than
this secrecy rate is not achievable. To do this, the capacity of a genie-aided
channel as an upper bound for the secrecy capacity of the underlying channel is
derived, showing this upper bound is equal to the computed achievable secrecy
rate with Gaussian input. Accordingly, the corresponding secrecy capacity is
compared to the Decode and Forward (DF) strategy which is served as the
benchmark in the current work.

unresolvable with current instrumentation, physical estimates of this region
have been published for years in the astronomical literature. These data,

consistent with the published data to within an order of magnitude. The model

  arXiv:1208.4816",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As demonstrated by Slepian et. al. in a sequence of classical papers, prolate
spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs) provide a natural and efficient tool for
computing with bandlimited functions defined on an interval. Recently, PSWFs
have been becoming increasingly popular in various areas in which such
functions occur - this includes physics (e.g. wave phenomena, fluid dynamics),
engineering (signal processing, filter design), etc.
  To use PSWFs as a computational tool, one needs fast and accurate numerical
algorithms for the evaluation of PSWFs and related quantities, as well as for
the construction of corresponding quadrature rules, interpolation formulas,
etc. During the last 15 years, substantial progress has been made in the design
of such algorithms. However, many of the existing algorithms tend to be
relatively slow when $c$ is large (e.g. c>10^4).
  In this paper, we describe several numerical algorithms for the evaluation of
PSWFs and related quantities, and design a class of PSWF-based quadratures for
the integration of bandlimited functions. While the analysis is somewhat
involved and will be published separately, the resulting numerical algorithms
are quite simple and efficient in practice. For example, the evaluation of the
$n$th eigenvalue of the prolate integral operator requires $O(n+c \cdot \log
c)$ operations; the construction of accurate quadrature rules for the
integration (and associated interpolation) of bandlimited functions with band
limit $c$ requires $O(c)$ operations. All algorithms described in this paper
produce results essentially to machine precision. Our results are illustrated
via several numerical experiments.

cooperation is maintained through most of the game. A game-theoretic reasoning
based on backward induction eliminates strategies step by step until defection
from the first round is the only remaining choice, reflecting the Nash
equilibrium of the game. We investigate the Nash equilibrium solution for two
different sets of strategies in an evolutionary context, using
replicator-mutation dynamics. The first set consists of conditional
cooperators, up to a certain round, while the second set in addition to these
contains two strategy types that react differently on the first round action:
The ""Convincer"" strategies insist with two rounds of initial cooperation,
trying to establish more cooperative play in the game, while the ""Follower""
strategies, although being first round defectors, have the capability to
respond to an invite in the first round. For both of these strategy sets,
iterated elimination of strategies shows that the only Nash equilibria are
given by defection from the first round. We show that the evolutionary dynamics
of the first set is always characterised by a stable fixed point, corresponding
to the Nash equilibrium, if the mutation rate is sufficiently small (but still
positive). The second strategy set is numerically investigated, and we find
that there are regions of parameter space where fixed points become unstable
and the dynamics exhibits cycles of different strategy compositions. The
results indicate that, even in the limit of very small mutation rate, the
replicator-mutation dynamics does not necessarily bring the system with
Convincers and Followers to the fixed point corresponding to the Nash
equilibrium of the game.

  Cartesian stochastic variational inequality problems","36 pages, submitted to Mathematical Programming",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by problems arising in decentralized control problems and
non-cooperative Nash games, we consider a class of strongly monotone Cartesian
variational inequality (VI) problems, where the mappings either contain
expectations or their evaluations are corrupted by error. Such complications
are captured under the umbrella of Cartesian stochastic variational inequality
problems and we consider solving such problems via stochastic approximation
(SA) schemes. Specifically, we propose a scheme wherein the steplength sequence
is derived by a rule that depends on problem parameters such as monotonicity
and Lipschitz constants. The proposed scheme is seen to produce sequences that
are guaranteed to converge almost surely to the unique solution of the problem.
To cope with networked multi-agent generalizations, we provide requirements
under which independently chosen steplength rules still possess desirable
almost-sure convergence properties. In the second part of this paper, we
consider a regime where Lipschitz constants on the map are either unavailable
or difficult to derive. Here, we present a local randomization technique that
allows for deriving an approximation of the original mapping, which is then
shown to be Lipschitz continuous with a prescribed constant. Using this
technique, we introduce a locally randomized SA algorithm and provide
almost-sure convergence theory for the resulting sequence of iterates to an
approximate solution of the original variational inequality problem. Finally,
the paper concludes with some preliminary numerical results on a stochastic
rate allocation problem and a stochastic Nash-Cournot game.

constant-modulus (CCM) adaptive algorithms for interference suppression in
wireless communications systems. The proposed scheme and algorithms are based
on a two-stage processing framework that consists of a transformation matrix
that performs dimensionality reduction followed by a reduced-rank estimator.
The complex structure of the transformation matrix of existing methods
motivates the development of a blind adaptive reduced-rank constrained (BARC)
scheme along with a low-complexity reduced-rank decomposition. The proposed
BARC scheme and a reduced-rank decomposition based on the concept of joint
interpolation, switched decimation and reduced-rank estimation subject to a set
of constraints are then detailed. The proposed set of constraints ensures that
the multi-path components of the channel are combined prior to dimensionality
reduction. In order to cost-effectively design the BARC scheme, we develop
low-complexity decimation techniques, stochastic gradient and recursive least
squares reduced-rank estimation algorithms. A model-order selection algorithm
for adjusting the length of the estimators is devised along with techniques for
determining the required number of switching branches to attain a predefined
performance. An analysis of the convergence properties and issues of the
proposed optimization and algorithms is carried out, and the key features of
the optimization problem are discussed. We consider the application of the
proposed algorithms to interference suppression in DS-CDMA systems. The results
show that the proposed algorithms outperform the best known reduced-rank
schemes, while requiring lower complexity.

century ago pointed to the fact that the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) paradigm
is inapplicable to compressible gases at Knudsen numbers (Kn) beyond the
continuum range, namely to noncontinua. However, in the case of continua,
wherein Kn approaches zero asymptotically, it is nevertheless (implicitly)
assumed in the literature that the compressible NSF equations remain
applicable. Surprisingly, this belief appears never to have been critically
tested; rather, most tests of the viability of the NSF equations for continuum
flows have, to date, effectively been limited to incompressible fluids, namely
liquids. Given that bivelocity hydrodynamic theory has recently raised
fundamental questions about the validity of the NSF equations for compressible
continuum gas flows, we deemed it worthwhile to test the validity of the NSF
paradigm for the case of continua. Although our proposed NSF test does not,
itself, depend upon the correctness of the bivelocity model that spawned the
test, the latter provided motivation. This Letter furnishes molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation evidence showing, contrary to current opinion, that the NSF
equations are not, in fact, applicable to compressible gaseous continua, nor,
presumably, either to compressible liquids. Importantly, this conclusion
regarding NSF's inapplicability to continua, is shown to hold independently of
the viability of the no-slip boundary condition applied to fluid continua, thus
separating the issue of the correctness of the NSF differential equations from
that of the tangential velocity boundary condition to be imposed upon these
equations when seeking their solution. Finally, the MD data are shown to be
functionally consistent with the bivelocity model that spawned the present
study.

indentify the dominant intrinsic error mechanism and derive an associated

gas accretion onto a core is the primary requisite, triggered when the core
mass reaches a critical value. The recently revealed wide diversity of the
extrasolar giant planets suggests the necessity to further the understanding of
the conditions resulting in the critical core mass that initiates runaway
accretion. We study the internal structure of protoplanets under hydrostatic
and thermal equilibria represented in terms of a polytropic equation of state
to investigate what factors determine and affect the critical core mass. We
find that the protoplanets, embedded in protoplanetary disks, have the same
configuration as red giants, characterized by the envelope of the
centrally-condensed type solution. Applying the theory of stellar structure
with homology invariants, we demonstrate that there are three types of criteria
for the critical core mass depending on the stiffness of polytrope and the
nature of outer boundary condition. For the stiff polytropes of index $N \le 3$
with the Bondi radius as the outer boundary, the criterion governing the
critical core mass occurs at the surface. For stiff polytropes with the Hill
outer boundary and for soft polytropes of $N>3$, this criterion acts at the
bottom of gaseous envelope. Further, we elucidate the roles and effects of
coexistent radiative and convective zones in the envelope of critical core
mass. Based on the results, we discuss the relevance of Bondi and Hill surface

important to gain an understanding of their demography and genetic diversity.
To date, however, genetic studies within these species have largely been
confined to mitochondrial DNA and a small number of other loci. Here, we
present a genome-wide survey of genetic variation in gorillas using a reduced
representation sequencing approach, focusing on the two lowland subspecies. We
identify 3,274,491 polymorphic sites in 14 individuals: 12 western lowland
gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and 2 eastern lowland gorillas (Gorilla
beringei graueri). We find that the two species are genetically distinct, based
on levels of heterozygosity and patterns of allele sharing. Focusing on the
western lowland population, we observe evidence for population substructure,
and a deficit of rare genetic variants suggesting a recent episode of
population contraction. In western lowland gorillas, there is an elevation of
variation towards telomeres and centromeres on the chromosomal scale. On a
finer scale, we find substantial variation in genetic diversity, including a
marked reduction close to the major histocompatibility locus, perhaps
indicative of recent strong selection there. These findings suggest that
despite their maintaining an overall level of genetic diversity equal to or
greater than that of humans, population decline, perhaps associated with
disease, has been a significant factor in recent and long-term pressures on
wild gorilla populations.

terms of coincident M2 branes sitting at the origin of a product of an A-type

Families of mirror dual pairs, which arise in this fashion, can be labeled as

maximum sum-rate in such a system does not necessarily demand the consumption
of all available power at the relay. Instead, the maximum sum-rate can be
achieved through efficient power allocation with minimum power consumption.
Deriving such power allocation, however, is nontrivial due to the fact that it
generally leads to a nonconvex problem. In Part I of this two-part paper, a
sum-rate maximizing power allocation with minimum power consumption is found
for MIMO DF two-way relaying, in which the relay optimizes its own power
allocation strategy given the power allocation strategies of the source nodes.
An algorithm is proposed for efficiently finding the optimal power allocation
of the relay based on the proposed idea of relative water-levels. The
considered scenario features low complexity due to the fact that the relay
optimizes its power allocation without coordinating the source nodes. As a
trade-off for the low complexity, it is shown that there can be waste of power
at the source nodes because of no coordination between the relay and the source
nodes. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm
and the effect of asymmetry on the considered system.

finite-length numerical seed is of great value in the field of random number
generation, computer simulations, and other areas of computer science.
Extending this idea such that the bitstring cannot be reverse-engineered to
recover the original seed value extends the value of such a system to the field
of cryptography, as the string can be used directly as an encryption mask, or
as the input to some other cryptographic function. The longer the string that
can be generated, the closer the system would come to the ideal cryptographic
case of the One Time Pad.
  In this paper we propose a scheme for taking an initial seed (nominally a
128-bit integer, but not restricted to such), and expanding this into a unique
bitstring of a length determined by a limit cycle that makes it useful in
practical applications. We utilize novel mathematical concepts such as
combinatorial decomposition to turn the seed value into unique rotations of a
pre-defined table, which are operated on via destructive functions such as
exclusive-OR (XOR) and add-with-carry (ADC) to eventually produce the unique
bitstring.
  We assert that the process of iterating the XOR or ADC operation conforms to
the known NP-complete problem known as Subset-Sum, meaning that the reversal of
the process that produced the bitstring is tantamount to solving the
NP-Complete Subset-Sum problem, which in turn is less efficient than the
brute-force method of testing every seed value until the corresponding
bitstring is found, making the system highly relevant in a cryptographic
context.

dominate the functional protein annotations collected in databases. Here we
investigate just how prevalent is the ""few articles -- many proteins""
phenomenon. We examine the experimentally validated annotation of proteins
provided by several groups in the GO Consortium, and show that the distribution
of proteins per published study is exponential, with 0.14% of articles
providing the source of annotations for 25% of the proteins in the UniProt-GOA
compilation. Since each of the dominant articles describes the use of an assay
that can find only one function or a small group of functions, this leads to
substantial biases in what we know about the function of many proteins.
Mass-spectrometry, microscopy and RNAi experiments dominate high throughput
experiments. Consequently, the functional information derived from these
experiments is mostly of the subcellular location of proteins, and of the
participation of proteins in embryonic developmental pathways. For some
organisms, the information provided by different studies overlap by a large
amount. We also show that the information provided by high throughput
experiments is less specific than those provided by low throughput experiments.
Given the experimental techniques available, certain biases in protein function
annotation due to high-throughput experiments are unavoidable. Knowing that
these biases exist and understanding their characteristics and extent is
important for database curators, developers of function annotation programs,

control in two-hop relay wireless networks without the information of both
eavesdropper channels and locations. The available secure transmission
protocols via relay cooperation in physical layer secrecy framework cannot
provide a flexible load-balance control, which may significantly limit their
application scopes. This paper extends the conventional works and proposes a
general transmission protocol with considering load-balance control, in which
the relay is randomly selected from the first $k$ preferable assistant relays
located in the circle area with the radius $r$ and the center at the middle
between source and destination (2HR-($r,k$) for short). This protocol covers
the available works as special cases, like ones with the optimal relay
selection ($r=\infty$, $k=1$) and with the random relay selection ($r=\infty$,
$k = n$ i.e. the number of system nodes) in the case of equal path-loss, ones
with relay selected from relay selection region ($r \in (0, \infty), k = 1$) in
the case of distance-dependent path-loss. The theoretic analysis is further
provided to determine the maximum number of eavesdroppers one network can
tolerate to ensure a desired performance in terms of the secrecy outage
probability and transmission outage probability. The analysis results also show
the proposed protocol can balance load distributed among the relays by a proper
setting of $r$ and $k$ under the premise of specified secure and reliable
requirements.

system based on the maximizing Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio

timing offset between the prototype pulses of the proposed Max-SINR receiver

matched to the channel scattering factor of the doubly dispersive (DD) channel.
The closed form timing offset expressions of the prototype pulse for Max-SINR
HMT receiver over DD channel with different channel scattering functions are
derived. Simulation results show that the proposed Max-SINR receiver
outperforms traditional projection scheme and obtains an approximation to the
theoretical upper bound SINR performance. Consistent with the SINR performance
improvement, the bit error rate (BER) performance of HMT system has also been
further improved by using the proposed Max-SINR receiver. Meanwhile, the SINR
performance of the proposed Max-SINR receiver is robust to the channel delay

theoretically and empirically. Nonetheless, these widely-adopted principles are
still insufficient to prevent attribute disclosure if the attacker has partial

supporting numerical sensitive attributes. However, in contrast to
$k$-anonymity and $l$-diversity, the theoretical aspect of $t$-closeness has
not been well investigated.
  We initiate the first systematic theoretical study on the $t$-closeness

for every constant $t$ such that $0\leq t<1$, it is NP-hard to find an optimal
$t$-closeness generalization of a given table. The proof consists of several
reductions each of which works for different values of $t$, which together
cover the full range. To complement this negative result, we also provide exact

hardcore model), much progress has been made. However, considerably less is
known in the presence of higher-order interactions, which arise e.g. in the
analysis of independent sets with special properties and the study of
resource-constrained communication networks. In this paper, we further our
understanding of such models by analyzing M.r.f. with second-order interactions
on the independent sets of the infinite Cayley tree. We prove that the
associated Gibbsian specification satisfies the celebrated FKG Inequality
whenever the local potentials defining the Hamiltonian satisfy a log-convexity
condition. Under this condition, we give necessary and sufficient conditions
for the existence of a unique infinite-volume Gibbs measure in terms of an
explicit system of equations, prove the existence of a phase transition, and
give explicit bounds on the associated critical activity, which we prove to
exhibit a certain robustness. For potentials which are small perturbations of
those coinciding to the hardcore model at the critical activity, we
characterize whether the resulting specification has a unique infinite-volume
Gibbs measure in terms of whether these perturbations satisfy an explicit
linear inequality. Our analysis reveals an interesting non-monotonicity with

that the vacuum contribution actually provides a small positive value to the

the quantum nature of the gravitational field, through a Casimir-like effect
from an additional compact dimension of space. A key ingredient is to assume
that only modes with wavelength shorter than the Hubble length contribute to
the vacuum. Such a contribution gives a positive energy density, has a Lorentz
invariant equation of state in the usual 4D spacetime and hence can be
interpreted as a cosmological constant. Its value agrees with observations for
a radius of a 5th extra dimension given by $35\,\mu$m. This implies a
modification of the gravitational inverse square law around this scale, close

description of nucleon structure and in the determination of dark matter direct
detection cross sections. As a measure of the strange-quark contribution to the
nucleon mass, the strange-quark sigma term (\sigma_s) provides important
insight into the nature of mass generation in QCD. The phenomenological
determination of \sigma_s exhibits a wide range of variation, with values
suggesting that the strange quark contributes anywhere between 0 and more than
30% of the nucleon mass. In the context of dark matter searches, coupled with
relatively large Higgs coupling to strangeness, this variation dominates the
uncertainty in predicted cross sections for a large class of dark matter
models. Here we report on the recent results in lattice QCD, which are now
giving a far more precise determination of \sigma_s than can be inferred from
phenomenology. As a consequence, the lattice determinations of \sigma_s can now
dramatically reduce the uncertainty in dark matter cross sections associated

its application to the analysis of nuclear fragments emitted almost
isotropically in nuclear evaporation. This system is able to recognize tracks
of nuclear fragments up to |tan{\theta}|< 3.0 (where {\theta} is the track
angle with respect to the perpendicular to the emulsion film), while existing
systems have an angular acceptance limited to |tan{\theta}|< 0.6. The automatic
scanning for such a large angle track in nuclear emulsion is the first trial.
Furthermore the track recognition algorithm is performed by a powerful Graphics

power to process large area scanning data with a wide angular acceptance and
enough flexibility to allow the tuning of the recognition algorithm. This new
system will in particular be applied in the framework of the OPERA experiment :
the background in the sample of tau decay candidates due to hadronic
interactions will be reduced by a better detection of the emitted nuclear

stack of BPS D3-branes located at the conifold singularity of the Calabi-Yau
three-fold, a new mechanism to address the cosmological constant problem in the
framework of the conventional compactifications where the $n$-form fluxes
including NS-NS three-form are all turned off. In this mechanism the
four-dimensional cosmological constant $\lambda$ appears as two types, NS-NS
type and R-R type, of vacuum energies on the brane plus supersymmetry breaking
term, which constitute a brane action density ${\hat I}_{\rm brane}$, and sum
of these three terms of ${\hat I}_{\rm brane}$ are forced to vanish by field
equations so that $\lambda$ adjusts itself to zero as a result. Also in this
mechanism the $d=4$ supersymmetry is broken in the brane region, while still
maintaining $\lambda =0$. The supersymmetry breaking occurs as a result of the
gauge symmetry breaking of the R-R four-form arising at the quantum level. We
generalize the above mechanism to the case of the flux compactifications where
the fluxes are all turned on to stabilize the moduli. In the generalized theory
$\lambda$ appears as ${\hat I}_{\rm brane}$ plus the scalar potential
${\mathcal V}_{\rm scalar}$ for the moduli, in contrast to the case of the
ordinary flux compactifications where $\lambda$ is simply given by ${\mathcal
V}_{\rm scalar}$. Also in this theory any nonzero ${\mathcal V}_{\rm scalar}$
arising from perturbative or nonperturbative corrections is gauged away by the
gauge arbitrariness of ${\hat I}_{\rm brane}$ and the condition $\lambda=0$. So
$\lambda$ is again expressed only as a brane action density as before, or it
simply vanishes by the cancelation between ${\hat I}_{\rm brane}$ and
${\mathcal V}_{\rm scalar}$.

experimental conditions to irreversibly switch magnetization using surface

two switching mechanisms are considered. In precessional switching, a small
in-plane field initially tilts the magnetization and the passage of the SAW
modifies the magnetic anisotropy parameters through inverse magneto-striction,
which triggers precession, and eventually reversal. Using the micromagnetic
parameters of a fully characterized layer of the magnetic semiconductor
(Ga,Mn)(As,P), we then show that there is a large window of accessible
experimental conditions (SAW amplitude/wave-vector, field
amplitude/orientation) allowing irreversible switching. As this is a resonant
process, the influence of the detuning of the SAW frequency to the magnetic
system's eigenfrequency is also explored. Finally, another - non-resonant -
switching mechanism is briefly contemplated, and found to be applicable to
(Ga,Mn)(As,P): SAW-assisted domain nucleation. In this case, a small
perpendicular field is applied opposite the initial magnetization and the
passage of the SAW lowers the domain nucleation barrier.

of the stars in the stellar bulge is extremely bottom heavy. The X-rays
originate in a power-law component of luminosity 1.3 times 10^40 erg/s embedded
in a 1 keV thermal minicorona which has a half-light radius of about 360 pc,
typical of many early-type galaxies in rich clusters of galaxies. If Bondi
accretion operated onto the UMBH from the minicorona with a radiative
efficiency of 10 per cent, then the object would appear as a quasar with
luminosity 10^46 erg/s, a factor of almost 10^6 times higher than observed. The
accretion flow must be highly radiatively inefficient, similar to past results
on M87 and NGC3115. The UMBH in NGC1277 is definitely not undergoing any
significant growth at the present epoch. We note that there are 3 UMBH
candidates in the Perseus cluster and that the inferred present mean mass
density in UMBH could be 10^5 Msun/Mpc^3, which is 20 to 30 per cent of the
estimated mean mass density of all black holes. We speculate on the implied
growth of UMBH and their hosts, and discuss the possibiity that extreme AGN
feedback could make all UMBH host galaxies have low stellar masses at redshifts
around 3. Only those which end up at the centres of groups and clusters later
accrete large stellar envelopes and become Brightest Cluster Galaxies. NGC1277

more stars or gas owing to their rapid orbital motion in the cluster core.

dynamical behaviour of qubits processed by entangling gates. The analysis gets
to the conclusion that a distinction between evaluation steps and task-oriented
computing steps is justified only within classical computation. In fact, the
use of entangling gates permits to reduce two steps (evaluation and
calculation) to a single computational one, and this determines an effective
computational speed-up. The application of the open quantum systems model
suggests that the reduction to one-computational step is strongly related to
the existence of Universal Dynamical Maps describing the evolution of component
systems of two-qubits gates. As the description in terms of Universal Dynamical
Map is possible only in the presence of a separable initial state, it turns out
that the internal reduced dynamics with respect to entangling gates is neither
unitary nor Markovian. The fact imposes a holistic vision on the structure of
the algorithm, where the entangling gates shall remain indivisible unities, or
black boxes, in order to preserve computational speed as well as reversibility.
This fact suggests to adopt a perspective on computation which is completely
non-classical: the whole algorithm turns out not to be the sequence of its
temporal parts.

about the probabilities of certain path properties or expected values of

is also another type of interesting performance measure, namely quantiles. A
typical quantile query takes as input a lower probability bound p and a
reachability property. The task is then to compute the minimal reward bound r
such that with probability at least p the target set will be reached before the
accumulated reward exceeds r. Quantiles are well-known from mathematical
statistics, but to the best of our knowledge they have not been addressed by
the model checking community so far.
  In this paper, we study the complexity of quantile queries for until
properties in discrete-time finite-state Markov decision processes with
non-negative rewards on states. We show that qualitative quantile queries can
be evaluated in polynomial time and present an exponential algorithm for the

self-intersections, the number of f- preimages of a point x in Lambda may
depend on x. This makes estimates of the stable dimensions more difficult than
for diffeomorphisms or for maps which are constant-to-one. We employ the
thermodynamic formalism in order to derive estimates for the stable Hausdorff
dimension function delta^s on Lambda, in the case when f is conformal on local
stable manifolds. These estimates are in terms of a continuous function on
Lambda which bounds the preimage counting function from below. As a corollary
we obtain that if delta^s attains its maximal possible value in Lambda, then
the stable dimension is constant throughout Lambda, whereas the preimage
counting function is constant on at least an open and dense subset of Lambda.
In particular, this shows that if at some point in Lambda, the stable dimension
is equal to the analogue of the similarity dimension in the stable direction at
that point, then f behaves very much like a homeomorphism on Lambda. Finally we
also obtain results about the stable upper box dimension for these type of
fractals. We end the paper with a discussion of two explicit examples.

transport and thermal fluctuations in determining the pore conductivity is
investigated. A second important effect that is observed is the mass transport
of water through the nanopore, with an average velocity proportional to the

consequence of the asymmetry in the ion distribution with respect to reflection

measuring the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays, looking for
information on the propagation mechanisms and the identification of their
sources. Any deviation from the isotropy may be regarded to as a signature of
unforeseen or unknown phenomena, mostly if well localised in the sky and
occurring at low rigidity. It induced experimenters to search for excesses down
to angular scale as narrow as 10 degrees, disclosing the issue of properly
filtering contributions from wider structures. A solution commonly envisaged in
these years based on time-average methods to determine the reference value of
cosmic ray flux. Such techniques are nearly insensitive to signals wider than
the time-window in use, thus allowing to focus the analysis on medium- and
small-scale signals. Nonetheless, often the signal cannot be excluded in the
calculation of the reference value, what induce systematic errors. The use of
time-average methods recently brought to important discoveries about the
medium-scale cosmic ray anisotropy, present both in the northern and southern
hemisphere. It is known that the excess (or the deficit) is observed as less
intense than in reality and that fake deficit zones are rendered around true
excesses, because of the absolute lack of knowledge a-priori of which signal is
true and which is not. This work is an attempt to critically review the use of
time average-based methods for observing extended features in the cosmic-ray
arrival distribution pattern.

controversial. We followed the evolution of the environment surrounding the

periastron to check for any evidence of a strong interaction between its
companion and the primary circumstellar disk. We used the VLTI/AMBER
spectro-interferometric instrument operating in the K band in high (12000)
spectral resolution to obtain information on both the disk geometry and
kinematics. Observations were carried out in two emission lines: Br$\gamma$
(2.172\,$\mu$m) and $\ion{He}{i}$ (2.056\,$\mu$m). We detected some important
changes in $\delta$ Scorpii's circumstellar disk geometry between the first
observation made in April 2010 and the new observation made in June 2012.
During the last two years the disk has grown at a mean velocity of
0.2\,km\,s$^{-1}$. This is compatible with the expansion velocity previously
found during the 2001-2007 period. The disk was also found to be asymmetric at
both epochs, but with a different morphology in 2010 and 2012. Considering the
available spectroscopic data showing that the main changes in the emission-line
profiles occurred quickly during the periastron, it is probable that the
differences between the 2010 and 2012 disk geometry seen in our interferometric
data stem from a disk perturbation caused by the companion tidal effects.
However, taking into account that no significant changes have occurred in the
disk since the end of the 2011 observing season, it is difficult to understand
how this induced inhomogeneity has been ""frozen"" in the disk for such a long
period.

Mission, we select seven targets with favorable properties for the capacity to
dynamically maintain an exomoon and present a detectable signal. These seven
candidates were identified through our automatic target selection (TSA)
algorithm and target selection prioritization (TSP) filtering, whereby we
excluded systems exhibiting significant time-correlated noise and focussed on
those with a single transiting planet candidate of radius less than 6 Earth
radii. We find no compelling evidence for an exomoon around any of the seven
KOIs but constrain the satellite-to-planet mass ratios for each. For four of
the seven KOIs, we estimate a 95% upper quantile of M_S/M_P<0.04, which given
the radii of the candidates, likely probes down to sub-Earth masses. We also
derive precise transit times and durations for each candidate and find no
evidence for dynamical variations in any of the KOIs. With just a few systems
analyzed thus far in the in-going HEK project, projections on eta-moon would be
premature, but a high frequency of large moons around
Super-Earths/Mini-Neptunes would appear to be incommensurable with our results
so far.

As a probe free from nuclear structure corrections the decay of the free
neutron has the potential to provide the most accurate value of V_{ud}. Towards
that end however, the experimental sensitivity still needs to be further
improved to become competitive with superallowed nuclear beta decays. This

transits up to three times deeper than the optical transit of WASP-12b reveal
extensive diffuse gas, extending well beyond the Roche lobe. The distribution
of absorbing gas varies between visits. The deepest NUV transits are at
wavelength ranges with strong photospheric absorption, implying the absorbing
gas may have temperature and composition similar to the stellar photosphere.
Our spectra reveal significantly enhanced absorption (greater than 3 \sigma
below the median) at ~200 wavelengths on each of two HST visits; 65 of these
wavelengths are consistent between the two visits, using a strict criterion for
velocity matching which excludes matches with velocity shifts exceeding ~20
km/s. Excess transit depths are robustly detected throughout the inner wings of
the MgII resonance lines independently on both HST visits. We detected
absorption in FeII 2586A, the heaviest species yet detected in an exoplanet
transit. The MgII line cores have zero flux, emission cores exhibited by every
other observed star of similar age and spectral type are conspicuously absent.
WASP-12 probably produces normal MgII profiles, but the inner portions of these
strong resonance lines are likely affected by extrinsic absorption. The
required Mg+ column is an order of magnitude greater than expected from the
ISM, though we cannot completely dismiss that possibility. A more plausible
source of absorption is gas lost by WASP-12b. We show that planetary mass loss
can produce the required column. Our Visit 2 NUV light curves show evidence for
a stellar flare. We show that some of the possible transit detections in
resonance lines of rare elements may be due instead to non-resonant transitions

function of galaxy luminosity, stellar mass, and SED type. Our analysis uses a
galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing technique (G3L), on angular scales between 9
arcsec to 50 arcmin, to quantify (i) the excess surface mass density around
galaxy pairs (excess mass hereafter) and (ii) the excess shear-shear
correlations around single galaxies, both of which yield a measure of two types
of galaxy-matter bispectra. We apply our method to the state-of-the-art
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), spanning 154 square
degrees. This survey allows us to detect a significant change of the bispectra
with lens properties. Measurements for lens populations with distinct redshift
distributions become comparable by a newly devised normalisation technique.
That will also aid future comparisons to other surveys or simulations. A
significant dependence of the normalised G3L statistics on luminosity within
-23<M_r<-18 and stellar mass within 5x10^9 M_sol<M_star<2x10^11 M_sol is found
(h=0.73). Both bispectra exhibit a stronger signal for more luminous lenses or
those with higher stellar mass (up to a factor 2-3). This is accompanied by a
steeper equilateral bispectrum for more luminous or higher stellar mass lenses
for the excess mass. Importantly, we find the excess mass to be very sensitive
to galaxy type as recently predicted with semi-analytic galaxy models: luminous
(M_r<-21) late-type galaxies show no detectable signal, while all excess mass
detected for luminous galaxies seems to be associated with early-type galaxies.

diamond remains a key challenge on the way towards efficient quantum

Although technologies based on implanting NV-center in bulk diamond crystals or
hybrid device approaches have been developed, they are limited in the
achievable spatial resolution and by the intricate technological complexities
involved in achieving scalability. We propose and demonstrate a novel approach
for creating an arrangement of NV-centers, based on the self-assembling
capabilities of biological systems and its beneficial nanometer spatial
resolution. Here, a self-assembled protein structure serves as a structural
scaffold for surface functionalized nanodiamonds, in this way allowing for the
controlled creation of NV-structures on the nanoscale and providing a new
avenue towards bridging the bio-nano interface. One-, two- as well as
three-dimensional structures are within the scope of biological structural
assembling techniques. We realized experimentally the formation of regular
structures by interconnecting nanodiamonds using biological protein scaffolds.
Based on the achievable NV-center distances of 11nm, we evaluate the expected
dipolar coupling interaction with neighboring NV-center as well as the expected
decoherence time. Moreover, by exploiting these couplings, we provide a
detailed theoretical analysis on the viability of multiqubit quantum
operations, suggest the possibility of individual addressing based on the
random distribution of the NV intrinsic symmetry axes and address the
challenges posed by decoherence and imperfect couplings. We then demonstrate in
the last part that our scheme allows for the high-fidelity creation of
entanglement, cluster states and quantum simulation applications.

evolution of protoplanetary disks and planet formation. Large solids are
supposed to drift inward; high-temperature minerals found in comets are assumed
to have been transported outward. From low-gravity experiments on parabolic
flights we studied the light-induced erosion of dusty bodies caused by a
solid-state greenhouse effect and photophoresis within a dust bed's upper
layers. The gravity levels studied were 0.16g, 0.38g, 1g, and 1.7g. The light
flux during the experiments was 12 +/- 2 kW/m^2 and the ambient pressure was 6
+/- 0.9 mbar. Light-induced erosion is strongly gravity dependent, which is in
agreement with a developed model. In particular for small dusty bodies
((sub)-planetesimals), efficient erosion is possible at the optically thin
inner edges of protoplanetary disks. Light-induced erosion prevents significant
parts of a larger body from moving too close to the host star and be being
subsequently accreted. The small dust produced continues to be subject to
photophoresis and is partially transported upward and outward over the surface
of the disk; the resulting small dust particles observed over the disk's
lifetime. The fraction of eroded dust participates in subsequent cycles of
growth during planetesimal formation. Another fraction of dust might be
collected by a body of planetary size if this body is already present close to
the disk edge. Either way, light induced erosion is an efficient recycling
process in protoplanetary disks.

find no significant difference in the deuterium fractionation between starless

to advanced core evolution. We only find significant correlations between the
deuterium fraction and increased H_2 column density, as well as with increased
central core density, for all cores. Towards protostellar sources, we
additionally find a significant anti-correlation between R_D and bolometric

depletion values relative to previous studies of star forming cores, similar to
recent results in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud. We suggest that the low
average CO depletion is the dominant mechanism that constrains the average
deuterium fractionation in the Perseus cores to small values. While current
equilibrium and dynamic chemical models are able to reproduce the range of
deuterium fractionation values we find in Perseus, reproducing the scatter

But, whenever it commits an error by misincorporating an incorrect nucleotide,
it can switch to an exonuclease mode. In the latter mode it excises the wrong
nucleotide before switching back to its polymerase mode. We develop a
stochastic kinetic model of DNA replication that mimics an {\it in-vitro}

the average rate of replication, which depends on the rates of both polymerase

  We also analyse the integrability conditions of the Killing spinor equations
of N=2 minimal gauged supergravity in four Euclidean dimensions. We obtain
necessary conditions for the existence of additional Killing spinors,

anti-self-dual then the supersymmetric metrics satisfying these conditions are
given by separable solutions to the $SU(\infty)$ Toda equation. Otherwise they
are ambi-K\""ahler and are conformally equivalent to K\""ahler metrics of Calabi

they interfere. Again, two previously strictly immiscible realms mix. Now,
modal terminology is insufficient. Both times, extreme reactions reach from
rejection of the empirical science to mystic holism. This paper shows how
progress started with the relativization of previously absolute terms, first
through Einstein's relativity and now through Everett's relative state
description, which is a modal realism. The historical parallels suggest mere
relativization is insufficient. A deformation of domains occurs: The determined
past and the dependent future were restricted to smaller regions of space-time.
This light cone description is superior to hyperspace foliations and already
entails the modal realism of quantum mechanics. Moreover, an entirely new
region, namely the ""absolute elsewhere"" was identified. The historical
precedent suggests that modal terminology may need a similar extension.
Discussing the modal realistic connection underlying both relativities,
Popper's proof of future indeterminism is turned to shatter the past already
into many worlds/minds, thus Everett relativity is merely the Bell inequality
violating correlation between possible empirical records.

type of information, and requires its own form of bookkeeping to properly
account for information accumulation. I illustrate both sets of books with a
simple coin-tossing (binomial) experiment. In thermodynamics, absolute
temperature T is the link that relates energy-based and entropy-based
bookkeeping systems. I consider the information-based analogue of this link,
denoted here as E, and show that E has a meaningful interpretation in its own

terms of a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Random telegraph noise (RTN) is
observed to be symmetrically enhanced in the hysteresis loop with regard to the
two magnetic configurations. We found that this enhancement is caused by the
fluctuation between two magnetic states in the free layer. Although the 1/f
noise is almost independent of the magnetic configuration, the RTN is enhanced
in the antiparallel configuration. These findings indicate the presence of
spin-dependent activation of RTN. Shot noise reveals the spin-dependent

It is designed for helping with typical algebraic manipulations that arise in
quantum Condensed Matter Physics and Nuclear Physics problems, and also in some
subareas of Chemistry. DiracQ is invoked within a Mathematica session, and
extends the symbolic capabilities of Mathematica by building in standard
commutation and anticommutation rules for several objects relevant in many-body
Physics. It enables the user to carry out computations such as evaluating the
commutators of arbitrary combinations of spin, Bose and Fermi operators defined
on a discrete lattice, or the position and momentum operators in the continuum.
Some examples from popular systems, such as the Hubbard model, are provided to
illustrate the capabilities of the package.

associated with one-body, uniform solenoidal currents in the case of the

occurs therefore only when only one eigenstate is occupied by all bosons. The

its orbit and energy. We discuss here measurements of such effects observed on
an electron beam accelerated in a CLIC prototype structure. Measurements of the
trajectory of bunch-trains on a nanosecond time-scale showed fast changes in

neuropsychiatric disorders. Such differences can be measured by labeled
cortical distance mapping (LCDM) which characterizes the morphometry of the
laminar cortical mantle of cortical structures. LCDM data consist of signed
distances of gray matter (GM) voxels with respect to GM/white matter (WM)
surface. Volumes and descriptive measures (such as means and variances) for
each subject and the pooled distances provide the morphometric differences
between diagnostic groups, but they do not reveal all the morphometric
information contained in LCDM distances. To extract more information from LCDM
data, censoring of the distances is introduced. For censoring of LCDM
distances, the range of LCDM distances is partitioned at a fixed increment
size; and at each censoring step, and distances not exceeding the censoring
distance are kept. Censored LCDM distances inherit the advantages of the pooled
distances. Furthermore, the analysis of censored distances provides information
about the location of morphometric differences which cannot be obtained from
the pooled distances. However, at each step, the censored distances aggregate,
which might confound the results. The influence of data aggregation is
investigated with an extensive Monte Carlo simulation analysis and it is
demonstrated that this influence is negligible. As an illustrative example, GM
of ventral medial prefrontal cortices (VMPFCs) of subjects with major
depressive disorder (MDD), subjects at high risk (HR) of MDD, and healthy
control (Ctrl) subjects are used. A significant reduction in laminar thickness
of the VMPFC and perhaps shrinkage in MDD and HR subjects is observed when
compared to Ctrl subjects. The methodology is also applicable to LCDM-based
morphometric measures of other cortical structures affected by disease.

Direct Integration of the Relaxed Einstein Equations (DIRE), adapted to
scalar-tensor theory, coupled with an approach pioneered by Eardley for
incorporating the internal gravity of compact, self-gravitating bodies. For the
conservative part of the motion, we obtain the two-body Lagrangian and
conserved energy and momentum through second post-Newtonian order. We find the
1.5 post-Newtonian and 2.5 post-Newtonian contributions to gravitational
radiation reaction, the former corresponding to the effects of dipole
gravitational radiation, and verify that the resulting energy loss agrees with
earlier calculations of the energy flux. For binary black holes we show that
the motion through 2.5 post-Newtonian order is observationally identical to
that predicted by general relativity. For mixed black-hole neutron-star binary
systems, the motion is identical to that in general relativity through the
first post-Newtonian order, but deviates from general relativity beginning at

radiation. But through 2.5 post-Newtonian order, those deviations in the motion
of a mixed system are governed by a single parameter dependent only upon the

standardization, a leap in throughput has been observed with every new
generation. The expectations for next generations on issues like throughput,
range, reliability, and power consumption are even higher. This is quite a
challenge considering all the work already done. Cross-layer optimization of
physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers can be an interesting
exploration path for further enhancement. During this thesis we have studied
cross-layer optimization techniques, with a focus on the IEEE 802.11ac
standard. A new multichannel aggregation scheme involving cross-knowledge
between PHY and MAC layers has been proposed to improve performance in
collision-prone environments. We have shown that some functionalities directly
involved PHY and MAC layers. An accurate modeling of both PHY and MAC
mechanisms is thus needed to have a realistic characterization of such
functionalities. A cross-layer simulator, compliant with IEEE 802.11ac
specifications, has thus been implemented. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first simulator incorporating detailed PHY and MAC functionalities for
the IEEE 802.11ac standard. The multiple-user multiple-input, multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) technique, which is one of the main innovations of the IEEE 802.11ac,
needs both PHY and MAC layer considerations. We have thus used the implemented
cross-layer simulator to evaluate the performance of MU-MIMO and compared it
with the single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO). The aim of these studies was to evaluate
the 'real' gains of MU-MIMO solutions (accounting for PHY+MAC) over SU-MIMO
solutions and not the generally accepted ones. The impact of the channel
sounding interval has particularly been studied. Finally, we have proposed a

KSTAR plasmas: 40 kHz magnetic fluctuations with a toroidal mode number of n=1.
Our analysis suggests this a beta-induced Alfven eigenmode resonant with the
q=1 surface. A kinetic analysis, when coupled with electron temperature
measurements from electron cyclotron emission and ion/electron temperature
ratios from crystallography, enables calculation of the frequency evolution,
which is in agreement with observations. Complementary detailed MHD modelling
of the magnetic configuration and wave modes supports the BAE mode conclusion,
by locating an n=1 mode separated from the continuum in the core region.
Finally, we have computed the threshold to marginal stability for a range of
ion temperature profiles. These suggest the BAE can be driven unstable by
energetic ions when the ion temperature radial gradient is sufficiently large.
Our findings suggest that mode existence could be used as a form of inference
for temperature profile consistency in the radial interval of the mode, thereby
extending the tools of MHD spectroscopy.

  Systems",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider an automatic overload control for two large service systems
modeled as multi-server queues, such as call centers. We assume that the two
systems are designed to operate independently, but want to help each other
respond to unexpected overloads. The proposed overload control automatically
activates sharing (sending some customers from one system to the other) once a
ratio of the queue lengths in the two systems crosses an activation threshold
(with ratio and activation threshold parameters for each direction). To prevent
harmful sharing, sharing is allowed in only one direction at any time. In this
paper, we are primarily concerned with ensuring that the system recovers
rapidly after the overload is over, either (i) because the two systems return
to normal loading or (ii) because the direction of the overload suddenly shifts
in the opposite direction. To achieve rapid recovery, we introduce lower
thresholds for the queue ratios, below which one-way sharing is released. As a
basis for studying the complex dynamics, we develop a new six-dimensional fluid
approximation for a system with time-varying arrival rates, extending a
previous fluid approximation involving a stochastic averaging principle. We
conduct simulations to confirm that the new algorithm is effective for
predicting the system performance and choosing effective control parameters.
The simulation and the algorithm both show that the system can experience an
inefficient nearly-periodic behavior, corresponding to an oscillating
equilibrium (congestion collapse), if the sharing is strongly inefficient and
the control parameters are set inappropriately.

flux spectra in two-layer and multi-layer quasi-geostrophic models. Its
physical significance is that it can diagnose whether any given multi-layer
model that allows co-existing downscale cascades of energy and potential
enstrophy can allow the downscale energy flux to become large enough to yield a
mixed energy spectrum where the dominant $k^{-3}$ scaling is overtaken by a
subdominant $k^{-5/3}$ contribution beyond a transition wavenumber $k_t$
situated in the inertial range. The validity of the flux inequality implies
that this scaling transition cannot occur within the inertial range, whereas a
violation of the flux inequality beyond some wavenumber $k_t$ implies the
existence of a scaling transition near that wavenumber. This flux inequality
holds unconditionally in two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence, however, it
is far from obvious that it continues to hold in multi-layer quasi-geostrophic
models, because the dissipation rate spectra for energy and potential enstrophy
no longer relate in a trivial way, as in two-dimensional Navier-Stokes. We
derive the general form of the energy and potential enstrophy dissipation rate
spectra for a generalized symmetrically coupled multi-layer model. From this
result, we prove that in a symmetrically coupled multi-layer quasi-geostrophic
model, where the dissipation terms for each layer consist of the same
Fourier-diagonal linear operator applied on the streamfunction field of only
the same layer, the flux inequality continues to hold. It follows that a
necessary condition to violate the flux inequality is the use of asymmetric
dissipation where different operators are used on different layers. etc.

different access methods on a link shared with Multi-Frequency Time Division
Multiple Access (MF-TDMA). This tech- nique is widely used in various network
technologies, such as satellite communication. In this context, different
access methods at the gateway induce different queuing delays and available
capacities, which strongly impact transport layer performance. Depending on QoS
requirements, design of new congestion and flow control mechanisms and/or
access methods requires evaluation through simulations.
  PCA module emulates the delays that packets will experience using the shared
link, based on descriptive parameters of lower layers characteris- tics. Though
PCA has been developed with DVB-RCS2 considerations in mind (for which we
present a use case), other MF-TDMA-based appli- cations can easily be simulated
by adapting input parameters. Moreover, the presented implementation details
highlight the main methods that might need modifications to implement more
specific functionality or emulate other similar access methods (e.g., OFDMA).

the ratio between the two sides or the ratio of the state total to the smaller

helpful for understanding the dynamics mechanism of the real-world two-way

There have been just a few existing results on link scheduling under the

cooperating the partition and shifting strategies into the pick-and-compare

algorithm in the linear power setting is the first localized algorithm that
achieves at least a constant fraction of the optimal capacity region subject to

type active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is investigated, based on a sample selected
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe-82 region with multi-epoch
photometric scanning data. As a comparison a control sample of broad-line
Seyfert 1 (BLS1) type AGNs is also incorporated. To quantify properly the
intrinsic variation amplitudes and their uncertainties, a novel method of
parametric maximum-likelihood is introduced, that has, as we argued, certain
virtues over previously used methods. The majority of NLS1-type AGNs exhibit
significant variability on timescales from about ten days to a few years with,
however, on average smaller amplitudes compared to BLS1-type AGNs. About 20
NLS1- type AGNs showing relatively large variations are presented, that may
deserve future monitoring observations, for instance, reverberation mapping.
The averaged structure functions of variability, constructed using the same
maximumlikelihood method, show remarkable similarity in shape for the two types
of AGNs on timescales longer than about 10 days, which can be approximated by a
power-law or an exponential function. This, along with other similar
properties, such as the wavelength-dependent variability, are indicative of a
common dominant mechanism responsible for the long-term optical/UV variability
of both NLS1- and BLS1-type AGNs. Towards the short timescales, however, there
is tentative evidence that the structure function of NLS1-type AGNs continues
declining, whereas that of BLS1-type AGNs flattens with some residual
variability on timescales of days. If this can be confirmed, it may suggest
that an alternative mechanism, such as X-ray reprocessing, starts to become
dominating in BLS1-type AGNs, but not in NLS1-, on such timescales.

spin-ladder system, in which antiferromagnetic exchange interactions act on the
nearest-neighbor and next-nearestneighbor bonds in the leg direction, and on
the nearest-neighbor bonds in the rung direction. A dynamical spin correlation
function at zero temperature is calculated by using the dynamical
density-matrix renormalization-group method for possible magnetic phases, i.e.,
columnar-dimer and rung-singlet phases. The columnar-dimer phase is
characterized by multi-spinon excitations with spin gap, while the rung-singlet
phase is dominated by the triplet excitation in the rung direction. It is found
that a major difference between these two phases appears in the spectral weight
of magnetic excitations, in particular, of the bonding and anti-bonding modes
in the rung direction. Therefore, we can distinguish one phase from the other
by the difference of the spectral weight. Furthermore, we examine frustration
effect on both modes in the rung-singlet phase with a perturbation theory from
the strong coupling limit. It is shown that the anti-bonding mode is stable
against the frustration, and a wavenumber with minimum excitation energy is
shifted from the commensurate to incommensurate ones. On the other hand, the
bonding mode is merged into the continuum excitation of multiple triplet
excitations by increasing the frustration. By comparing our results with
inelastic neutron scattering experiments for BiCu$_2$PO$_6$, the magnitude of
the magnetic exchange interactions and the ground state will be determined.

be constructed with the choice of r-band concentration index ci=2.85. The
opposite is not true, however, due to the fairly high contamination of an
early-type sample by late-type galaxies. In such an analysis, the influence of
selection effects is less important. To disentangle correlations of the
morphology and concentration index with stellar mass, star formation rate
(SFR), specific star formation rate (SSFR) and active galactic nucleus (AGN)
activity, I investigate correlations of the concentration index with these
properties at a fixed morphology and correlations of the morphology with these
properties at a fixed concentration index. It is found that at a fixed
morphology, high-concentration galaxies are preferentially more massive and
have a lower SFR and SSFR than low-concentration galaxies, while at a fixed
concentration index, elliptical galaxies are preferentially more massive and
have a lower SFR and SSFR than spiral galaxies. This result shows that the
stellar mass, SFR and SSFR of a galaxy are correlated with its concentration
index as well as its morphology. In addition, I note that AGNs are
preferentially found in more concentrated galaxies only in the spiral galaxy

disadvantage of being immutably connected to the selection of a particular

dynamo model used generalizes the standard theory to include the delayed
response of the mean electromotive force to variations of the mean magnetic
field and turbulence parameters (the temporal non-locality, or {\tau} effect).
The effect of the spiral pattern on the dynamo considered is the enhancement of
the {\alpha}-effect in spiral-shaped regions (which may overlap the gaseous
spiral arms or be located in the interarm regions). The axisymmetric and
enslaved non-axisymmetric modes of the mean magnetic field are studied
semi-analytically to clarify and strengthen the numerical results. Good
qualitative agreement is obtained between the asymptotic solution and numerical
solutions of Paper I for a global, rigidly rotating material spiral (density
wave). At all galactocentric distances except for the co-rotation radius, we
find magnetic arms displaced in azimuth from the {\alpha}-arms, so that the
ridges of magnetic field strength are more tightly wound than the
{\alpha}-arms. Moreover, the effect of a finite dynamo relaxation time {\tau}
(related to the turbulence correlation time) is to phase-shift the magnetic
arms in the direction opposite to the galactic rotation even at the co-rotation
radius. This mechanism can be used to explain the phase shifts between magnetic
and material arms observed in some spiral galaxies.

the extremum probability measures of such problems are obtained in closed form,
by identifying the partition of the support set and the mass of these extremum
measures on the partition. The results are derived for abstract spaces;
specifically, complete separable metric spaces known as Polish spaces, while
the high level ideas are also discussed for denumerable spaces endowed with the
discrete topology. These extremum problems often arise in many areas, such as,
approximating a family of probability distributions by a given probability
distribution, maximizing or minimizing entropy subject to total variational
distance metric constraints, quantifying uncertainty of probability
distributions by total variational distance metric, stochastic minimax control,
and in many problems of information, decision theory, and minimax theory.

of enigmatic objects, which have been extensively investigated in past few
decades. Based on the ample information about their timing behaviors, spectra,
and variability properties, it was proposed that SGRs/AXPs are isolated neutron
stars (NSs) with extremely strong magnetic fields, the so-called magnetars.
Nonetheless, some alternative models are probably equally convincing such as
those proposing that they are accreting NSs with a fall-back disk or
rotation-powered magnetized and massive white dwarfs. The nature and nurture of
SGRs/AXPs remain controversial. In this paper, we propose that SGRs/AXPs can
originate from normal NSs in binary systems. SGRs are a class of objects
containing a neutron-drip core and denser crust with a stiffer equation of
state, which is formed from re-explosion of normal NSs in binary systems. It is
the accretion onto the denser crust that contributes to the observed hard
emissions. AXPs are a group of NSs which reserve huge thermal energy in an
insulating layer above the surface. This structure accretes material from a
massive disk, manifesting themselves via release of deposited energy. The
spin-period clustering is due to either the brake of a slowly rotating envelope
or the frictional drag during the common-envelope phase.

the present work, we find this condition is not necessary and predict that the
quantum anomalous Hall effect can also be induced by the purely in-plane
magnetization in two realistic systems, including Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin film with
magnetic doping and HgMnTe quantum wells with shear strains, when all the
reflection symmetries are broken. An experimental setup is proposed to confirm
this effect, the observation of which will pave the way to search for the

take decision regarding fault detection in a noisy environment as a result of
false detection or false response of event by some sensors, where the sensors
are placed at the center of regular hexagons and the event can occur at only
one hexagon. We propose fault detection schemes that explicitly introduce the
error probabilities into the optimal event detection process. We introduce two
types of detection probabilities, one for the center node, where the event
occurs and the other one for the adjacent nodes. This second type of detection
probability is new in sensor network literature. We develop schemes under the
model selection procedure, multiple model selection procedure and use the
concept of Bayesian model averaging to identify a set of likely fault sensors
and obtain an average predictive error.

  2150-2162, April 2014",,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since radio signals carry both energy and information at the same time, a
unified study on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)
has recently drawn a significant attention for achieving wireless powered
communication networks. In this paper, we study a multiple-input single-output
(MISO) multicast SWIPT network with one multi-antenna transmitter sending
common information to multiple single-antenna receivers simultaneously along
with opportunistic wireless energy harvesting at each receiver. From the
practical consideration, we assume that the channel state information (CSI) is
only known at each respective receiver but is unavailable at the transmitter.
We propose a novel receiver mode switching scheme for SWIPT based on a new
application of the conventional random beamforming technique at the
multi-antenna transmitter, which generates artificial channel fading to enable
more efficient energy harvesting at each receiver when the received power
exceeds a certain threshold. For the proposed scheme, we investigate the
achievable information rate, harvested average power and/or power outage
probability, as well as their various trade-offs in both AWGN and quasi-static
fading channels. Compared to a reference scheme of periodic receiver mode
switching without random transmit beamforming, the proposed scheme is shown to
be able to achieve better rate-energy trade-offs when the harvested energy
target is sufficiently large. Particularly, it is revealed that employing one
single random beam for the proposed scheme is asymptotically optimal as the
transmit power increases to infinity, and also performs the best with finite
transmit power for the high harvested energy regime of most practical
interests, thus leading to an appealing low-complexity implementation. Finally,
we compare the rate-energy performances of the proposed scheme with different
random beam designs.

plays a crucial role in establishing bounds on the Kolmogorov distance between

of n integer points is introduced. The approach employs a ranking function that
avoids sorting the points directly thus reducing the overall time complexity.
The ranked points create a simple polygonal chain from which the Convex Hull
can be found using a suitable O(n) method. The result is achieved by placing a
bound on the density (or ratio) of points to m, where m is the maximum value of
the ranking function required to represent the set of points yielding an O(n+m)
method. A fast method is then developed based on the bit length, p, of the data
set which reduces this time further. The required conditions are easily
satisfied by image processing methods which determine the Hulls of polygonal
regions where the densities are in the range of 3%. Our experiments on a range

method is related to the bit size p for current machines (p=32, p=64) the
method is for all practical purposes O(n). A short proof is provided.

of superconductivity have been put forth: One is mediated by spin fluctuations
leading to the s+- state with sign change of superconducting gap between the
hole and electron bands, and the other is orbital fluctuations which favor the
s++ state without sign reversal. Here we report direct observation of peculiar
momentum-dependent anisotropy in the superconducting gap from angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 (Tc=30 K). The large
anisotropy found only in the electron Fermi surface (FS) and the nearly
isotropic gap on the entire hole FSs are together consistent with modified s+-
gap with nodal loops, which can be theoretically reproduced by considering both
spin and orbital fluctuations whose competition generates the gap modulation.
This indicates that these two fluctuations are nearly equally important to the
high-Tc superconductivity in this system.

the OH main line maser population in the nearby starburst galaxy M82. Sometimes
referred to as 'kilomasers', they have isotropic luminosities intermediate
between Galactic masers and those found in more distant megamasers. Several
observations have been carried by this group over the last ten years in an
attempt to get a better handle on their nature. High velocity resolution VLA
observations in 2006 showed that almost all of the maser spots, distributed
across the central arcminute of the galaxy, were apparently coincident with
background continuum features, and a handful displayed multiple velocity
components. The majority of those with velocity structure are located on a
blue-shifted arc in the pv-plane, spatially located on an arc northward of the
peculiar source known as B41.95+57.5. Now, new results from high spatial and
spectral resolution observations with the EVN have resolved several of these
masers into multiple spatial components for the first time. The maser emission
is compared with known continuum sources in the galaxy, and we conclude that at
least some of the maser emission is from high-gain maser action.

also determine the spatial extent of the emission and investigate the

strong atomic and molecular far-infrared emission. Water is detected in 17
objects, including 5 Class I sources. The high-excitation H2O line at 63.3
micron is detected in 7 sources. CO transitions from J=14-13 up to 49-48 are
found and show two distinct temperature components on Boltzmann diagrams with
rotational temperatures of ~350 K and ~700 K. H2O has typical excitation
temperatures of ~150 K. Emission from both Class 0 and I sources is usually
spatially extended along the outflow direction but with a pattern depending on
the species and the transition. The H2O line fluxes correlate strongly with
those of the high-J CO lines, as well as with the bolometric luminosity and
envelope mass. They correlate less strongly with OH and not with [OI] fluxes.
The PACS data probe at least two physical components. The H2O and CO emission
likely arises in non-dissociative (irradiated) shocks along the outflow walls
with a range of pre-shock densities. Some OH is also associated with this
component, likely resulting from H2O photodissociation. UV-heated gas
contributes only a minor fraction to the CO emission observed by PACS, based on
the strong correlation between the shock-dominated CO 24-23 line and the CO
14-13 line. [OI] and some of the OH emission probe dissociative shocks in the
inner envelope. The total far-infrared cooling is dominated by H2O and CO, with
[OI] increasing for Class I sources.

for use in such studies is the ""periodogram"", whose use in an astronomical

periodogram are lost in the case of irregular sampling of signals, which is a
common situation in astronomical experiments. Parts of these properties are
recovered by the ""Lomb-Scargle"" (LS) technique, but at the price of theoretical
difficulties, that can make its use unclear, and of algorithms that require the
development of dedicated software if a fast implementation is necessary. Such
problems would be irrelevant if the LS periodogram could be used to
significantly improve the results obtained by approximated but simpler

the outstanding cosmological problems of the Hubble Constant and of departures
from the mean cosmic flow. The correlation between galaxy luminosities and
rotation rates can be used to determine distances to many thousands of galaxies
in a wide range of environments potentially out to 200 Mpc. Mid-infrared (3.6
microns) photometry with the Spitzer Space Telescope is particularly valuable
as the source of the luminosities because it provides products of uniform
quality across the sky. From a perch above the atmosphere, essentially the
total magnitude of targets can be registered in exposures of a few minutes.
Extinction is minimal and the flux is dominated by the light from old stars
which is expected to correlate with the mass of the targets.
  In spite of the superior photometry, the correlation between mid-infrared
luminosities and rotation rates extracted from neutral hydrogen profiles is
slightly degraded from the correlation found with I band luminosities. A color
correction recovers a correlation that provides comparable accuracy to that
available at I band (~20% 1sigma in an individual distance) while retaining the
advantages identified above. Without the color correction the relation between
linewidth and [3.6] magnitudes is M^{b,i,k,a}_{[3.6]} = -20.34 - 9.74 (log
W_{mx}^{i} -2.5). This description is found with a sample of 213 galaxies in 13
clusters that define the slope and 26 galaxies with Cepheid or tip of the red
giant branch distances that define the zero point. A color corrected parameter

theoretically revealed by studying the BEC-BCS-laser crossover in

second thresholds; one is a crossover within quasi-equilibrium phases and the
other is into non-equilibrium (lasing). In both cases, the light-induced band
renormalization causes gaps in the conduction and valence bands, which
indicates the exsistence of bound electron-hole pairs in contrast to earlier
expectations. We also show that these two types can be distinguished by the

service agents provided with varying Quality of Service (QoS) levels,
effectively forming a multiagent system (MAS). Selecting a (near-)optimal set
of services for a composition in terms of QoS is crucial when many functionally
equivalent services are available. As the number of distributed services,
especially in the cloud, is rising rapidly, the impact of the network on the
QoS keeps increasing. Despite this and opposed to most MAS approaches, current
service approaches depend on a centralized architecture which cannot adapt to
the network. Thus, we propose a scalable distributed architecture composed of a
flexible number of distributed control nodes. Our architecture requires no
changes to existing services and adapts from a centralized to a completely
distributed realization by adding control nodes as needed. Also, we propose an
extended QoS aggregation algorithm that allows to accurately estimate network
QoS. Finally, we evaluate the benefits and optimality of our architecture in a
distributed environment.

it allows to generate digital representations of our physical world used as

reconstruction itself normally is based on reliable data (images, 3D point
clouds for example) expressing the object in his complete extent. This data
then has to be compiled and analyzed in order to extract all necessary
geometrical elements, which represent the object and form a digital copy of it.
Traditional strategies are largely based on manual interaction and
interpretation, because with increasing complexity of objects human
understanding is inevitable to achieve acceptable and reliable results. But
human interaction is time consuming and expensive, why many researches has
already been invested to use algorithmic support, what allows to speed up the
process and to reduce manual work load. Presently most of such supporting
algorithms are data-driven and concentate on specific features of the objects,
being accessible to numerical models. By means of these models, which normally
will represent geometrical (flatness, roughness, for example) or physical
features (color, texture), the data is classified and analyzed. This is
successful for objects with low complexity, but gets to its limits with
increasing complexness of objects. Then purely numerical strategies are not
able to sufficiently model the reality. Therefore, the intention of our
approach is to take human cognitive strategy as an example, and to simulate
extraction processes based on available human defined knowledge for the objects
of interest. Such processes will introduce a semantic structure for the objects
and guide the algorithms used to detect and recognize objects, which will yield
a higher effectiveness. Hence, our research proposes an approach using
knowledge to guide the algorithms in 3D point cloud and image processing.

trajectories generated by unimodal maps close to an inverse tangent bifurcation
and construct, according to the Horizontal Visibility algorithm, their
associated graphs. We show how the alternation of laminar episodes and chaotic
bursts has a fingerprint in the resulting graph structure. Accordingly, we
derive a phenomenological theory that predicts quantitative values of several
network parameters. In particular, we predict that the characteristic power law
scaling of the mean length of laminar trend sizes is fully inherited in the
variance of the graph degree distribution, in good agreement with the numerics.
We also report numerical evidence on how the characteristic power-law scaling
of the Lyapunov exponent as a function of the distance to the tangent
bifurcation is inherited in the graph by an analogous scaling of the block
entropy over the degree distribution. Furthermore, we are able to recast the
full set of HV graphs generated by intermittent dynamics into a renormalization
group framework, where the fixed points of its graph-theoretical RG flow
account for the different types of dynamics. We also establish that the
nontrivial fixed point of this flow coincides with the tangency condition and
that the corresponding invariant graph exhibit extremal entropic properties.

the prompt emission spectra of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, deviations
from this function have previously been observed in GRBs detected by BATSE and
in individual GRBs from the \textit{Fermi} era. We present a systematic and
rigorous search for spectral deviations from a Band function at low energies in
a sample of the first two years of high fluence, long bursts detected by the
\textit{Fermi} Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM). The sample contains 45 bursts
with a fluence greater than 2$\times10^{-5}$ erg / cm$^{2}$ (10 - 1000 keV). An
extrapolated fit method is used to search for low-energy spectral anomalies,
whereby a Band function is fit above a variable low-energy threshold and then
the best fit function is extrapolated to lower energy data. Deviations are
quantified by examining residuals derived from the extrapolated function and
the data and their significance is determined via comprehensive simulations
which account for the instrument response. This method was employed for both
time-integrated burst spectra and time-resolved bins defined by a signal to
noise ratio of 25 $\sigma$ and 50 $\sigma$. Significant deviations are evident
in 3 bursts (GRB\,081215A, GRB\,090424 and GRB\,090902B) in the time-integrated
sample ($\sim$ 7%) and 5 bursts (GRB\,090323, GRB\,090424, GRB\,090820,
GRB\,090902B and GRB\,090926A) in the time-resolved sample ($\sim$ 11%).} The
advantage of the systematic, blind search analysis is that it can demonstrate
the requirement for an additional spectral component without any prior
knowledge of the nature of that extra component. Deviations are found in a
large fraction of high fluence GRBs; fainter GRBs may not have sufficient
statistics for deviations to be found using this method.

feedback arrangement between the linearised system and the remaining, normally
neglected, nonlinear part. The linear system is reduced using a method similar
to balanced truncation, but preserving bounds on the supply rate. The method
involves balancing two algebraic Riccati equations. The bounds are then used to

a corresponding distribution of parameterized tasks/goals. The architecture
makes the robot sample actively novel parameterized tasks in the task space,
based on a measure of competence progress, each of which triggers low-level
goal-directed learning of the motor policy pa- rameters that allow to solve it.
For both learning and generalization, the system leverages regression
techniques which allow to infer the motor policy parameters corresponding to a
given novel parameterized task, and based on the previously learnt
correspondences between policy and task parameters. We present experiments with
high-dimensional continuous sensorimotor spaces in three different robotic
setups: 1) learning the inverse kinematics in a highly-redundant robotic arm,
2) learning omnidirectional locomotion with motor primitives in a quadruped
robot, 3) an arm learning to control a fishing rod with a flexible wire. We
show that 1) exploration in the task space can be a lot faster than exploration
in the actuator space for learning inverse models in redundant robots; 2)
selecting goals maximizing competence progress creates developmental
trajectories driving the robot to progressively focus on tasks of increasing
complexity and is statistically significantly more efficient than selecting
tasks randomly, as well as more efficient than different standard active motor
babbling methods; 3) this architecture allows the robot to actively discover
which parts of its task space it can learn to reach and which part it cannot.

measurements of the particle size distribution. We assume that $K(x,y)$ is a

then reduces to a simpler problem of determining a function of a single

properties of $K(x,y)$. The price of this simplification is that the resulting
least squares problem is nonlinear in the exponents $\mu$ and $\nu$. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a selection of coalescence
problems arising in polymer physics, cloud science and astrophysics. The
applications include examples in which the particle size distribution is
stationary owing to the presence of sources and sinks of particles and examples
in which the particle size distribution is undergoing self-similar relaxation

the state estimation problem available, and apply readily to nonlinear systems
with non-Gaussian uncertainties. The present paper introduces a novel method
for implementing grid-based Bayesian estimation which largely sidesteps the
severe computational expense that has prevented the widespread use of such
methods. The method represents the evolution of the probability density
function (PDF) in phase space, $p_{\x}(\x',t)$, discretized on a fixed
Cartesian grid over {\it all} of phase space, and consists of two main steps:
(i) Between measurement times, $p_{\x}(\x',t)$ is evolved via numerical
discretization of the Kolmogorov forward equation, using a Godunov method with
second-order corner transport upwind correction and a total variation
diminishing flux limiter; (ii) at measurement times, $p_{\x}(\x',t)$ is updated
via Bayes' theorem. Computational economy is achieved by exploiting the
localised nature of $p_{\x}(\x',t)$. An ordered list of cells with
non-negligible probability, as well as their immediate neighbours, is created
and updated, and the PDF evolution is tracked {\it only} on these active cells.
%The grid-based discretization of $p_{\x}(\x',t)$ in this approach avoids the
requirement for resampling associated with particle-based representations of
the PDF.

a random variable is re-examined. A random variable is usually described by the
probability density function (PDF) or by its Fourier transform, namely the
characteristic function (CF). The CF can be further expressed by a Taylor
series involving the moments of the random variable. However, in some
circumstances, the moments do not exist and the Taylor expansion of the CF is
useless. This happens for example in the case of $\alpha$--stable random
variables. Here, the problem of representing the CF or the PDF of random
variables (r.vs) is examined by introducing fractional calculus. Two very
remarkable results are obtained. Firstly, it is shown that the fractional
derivatives of the CF in zero coincide with fractional moments. This is true
also in case of CF not derivable in zero (like the CF of $\alpha$--stable
r.vs). Moreover, it is shown that the CF may be represented by a generalized
Taylor expansion involving fractional moments. The generalized Taylor series
proposed is also able to represent the PDF in a perfect dual representation to
that in terms of CF. The PDF representation in terms of fractional moments is
especially accurate in the tails and this is very important in engineering
problems, like estimating structural safety.

through a model three-dimensional (3D) porous medium at pore-scale resolution.
Using confocal microscopy, we directly image the drainage of the medium by the
non-wetting oil and subsequent imbibition by the wetting fluid. During
imbibition, the wetting fluid pinches off threads of oil in the narrow crevices
of the medium, forming disconnected oil ganglia. Some of these ganglia remain
trapped within the medium. By resolving the full 3D structure of the trapped
ganglia, we show that the typical ganglion size, and the total amount of
residual oil, decreases as the capillary number Ca increases; this behavior
reflects the competition between the viscous pressure in the wetting fluid and
the capillary pressure required to force oil through the pores of the medium.
This work thus shows how pore-scale fluid dynamics influence the trapped fluid
configurations in multiphase flow through 3D porous media.

Higgs mu-term, and allows an exit from inflation to a vacuum characterised by
large Higgs vevs. The true ground state is reached after an period of thermal

phenomenon in which a state consisting entirely of positive momenta may have

of superpositions of gaussian wave packets, although the size of the effect is
small. Inspired by the numerical results of Penz et al, we present a wave
function whose current at any time may be computed analytically and which has
periods of significant backflow, with a backwards flux equal to about 70
percent of the maximum possible backflow, a dimensionless number $c_{bm}
\approx 0.04 $, discovered by Bracken and Melloy. This number has the unusual
property of being independent of $\hbar$ (and also of all other parameters of
the model), despite corresponding to a quantum-mechanical effect, and we shed
some light on this surprising property by considering the classical limit of
backflow. We conclude by discussing a specific measurement model in which
backflow may be identified in certain measurable probabilities.

for extremely metal poor stellar populations with [Fe/H] < -1. We also find
that the extended accretion shells around M49 are distinctly redder than the
galaxy's surrounding halo, suggesting that we are likely witnessing the buildup
of both the stellar mass and metallicity in M49's outer halo due to late time
accretion. While such growth of galaxy halos is predicted by models of
hierarchical accretion, this growth is thought to be driven by more massive
accretion events which have correspondingly higher mean metallicity than
inferred for M49's halo. Thus the extremely metal-poor nature of M49's extended

OWL ontology language, the Semantic Web Rule Language, and 3D processing
built-ins aiming at combining geometrical analysis of 3D point clouds and
specialist's knowledge. Here, we share our experience regarding the creation of
3D semantic facility model out of unorganized 3D point clouds. Thus, a
knowledge-based detection approach of objects using the OWL ontology language
is presented. This knowledge is used to define SWRL detection rules. In
addition, the combination of 3D processing built-ins and topological Built-Ins
in SWRL rules allows a more flexible and intelligent detection, and the
annotation of objects contained in 3D point clouds. The created WiDOP prototype
takes a set of 3D point clouds as input, and produces as output a populated
ontology corresponding to an indexed scene visualized within VRML language. The
context of the study is the detection of railway objects materialized within
the Deutsche Bahn scene such as signals, technical cupboards, electric poles,
etc. Thus, the resulting enriched and populated ontology, that contains the
annotations of objects in the point clouds, is used to feed a GIS system or an
IFC file for architecture purposes.

  3D Selective Nef Complexes and Logic Rules for bodies","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1301.4780","International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Ontology
  Development, Barcelone : Spain (2012)",,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a method to compute automatically topological relations
using SWRL rules. The calculation of these rules is based on the definition of
a Selective Nef Complexes Nef Polyhedra structure generated from standard
Polyhedron. The Selective Nef Complexes is a data model providing a set of
binary Boolean operators such as Union, Difference, Intersection and Symmetric
difference, and unary operators such as Interior, Closure and Boundary. In this
work, these operators are used to compute topological relations between objects
defined by the constraints of the 9 Intersection Model (9-IM) from Egenhofer.
With the help of these constraints, we defined a procedure to compute the
topological relations on Nef polyhedra. These topological relationships are
Disjoint, Meets, Contains, Inside, Covers, CoveredBy, Equals and Overlaps, and
defined in a top-level ontology with a specific semantic definition on relation
such as Transitive, Symmetric, Asymmetric, Functional, Reflexive, and
Irreflexive. The results of the computation of topological relationships are
stored in an OWL-DL ontology allowing after what to infer on these new
relationships between objects. In addition, logic rules based on the Semantic
Web Rule Language allows the definition of logic programs that define which
topological relationships have to be computed on which kind of objects with
specific attributes. For instance, a ""Building"" that overlaps a ""Railway"" is a
""RailStation"".

a frustrated Heisenberg $J_1-J_2$ model on a honeycomb lattice by employing the
Schwinger boson technique. The phase diagram and spin gap as functions of
${J}_{2}/{J}_{1}$ are presented, showing that the exotic spin liquid phase lies
in $0.21<{J}_{2}/{J}_{1} <0.43$. The temperature and magnetic-field dependences
of specific heat, magnetic susceptibility and Knight shift are also presented.
We find the spin liquid state is robust with respect to external magnetic
field. These results provide clear information characterizing unusual
properties of the exotic spin liquid phase for further experiments.

from the Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz (MALT90) survey and the
GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL mid-infrared survey of the inner Galaxy. The physical and
chemical characteristics of the 14 IRDCs are investigated using N2H+(1-0),
HNC(1-0), HCO+(1-0), and HCN(1-0) molecular lines. We find that the 14 IRDCs
are in different evolutionary stages from the ""starless"" to the sources with an
UCHII region. Three IRDCs are detected to have the star forming activities. The
integrated intensity ratios I(HCO+)/I(HCN), I(N2H+)/I(HCN), and I(HNC)/I(HCN)
are all about 1.5, which is different from the previous measurements,
suggesting that the integrated intensity ratios may be affected by the cloud
environments. The integrated intensities of HNC, HCO+ and HCN show a tight
correlation for the 14 IRDCs, implying a close link to the chemical evolution
of these three species in the IRDCs. The derived excitation temperature for
each IRDC is less than 25 K. We estimate the abundances of the four molecules
from 10^(-11) to 10^(-9), and the average abundance ratios N(HNC)/N(HCN) = 1.4+
-0.50, N(HNC)/N(HCO+) = 1.74 + - 0.22, N(HCN)/N(HCO+)= 1.21 + - 0.41.

which is widely argued to violate the principle of Local Causality. By
contrast, here we shall show that the Schr\""odinger equation with Born's
statistical interpretation of wave function and uncertainty relation can be
derived from a statistical model of microscopic stochastic deviation from
classical mechanics which is selected uniquely, up to a free parameter, by the
principle of Local Causality. Quantization is thus argued to be physical and
Planck constant acquires an interpretation as the average stochastic deviation
from classical mechanics in a microscopic time scale. Unlike canonical
quantization, the resulting quantum system always has a definite configuration
all the time as in classical mechanics, fluctuating randomly along a continuous
trajectory. The average of the relevant physical quantities over the
distribution of the configuration are shown to be equal numerically to the
quantum mechanical average of the corresponding Hermitian operators over a
quantum state.

between them to transmit power from the input to the output pulleys. A
compression belt composed of a great number of struts is maintained by a
tension flat belt. Power is them shared into the two belts that moves generally
in opposite directions. Due to the particular geometry of the elements and to
the great number of parts, a numerical approach achieves the global equilibrium
of the mechanism from the elementary part equilibrium. Sliding arc on each
pulley can be thus defined both for the compression and tension belts. Finally,
power sharing can be calculated as differential motion between the belts, is
defined. The first part of the paper will present the different steps of the
quasi-static mechanical analysis and their numerical implementations. Load
distributions, speed profiles and sliding angle values will be discussed. The
second part of the paper will deal to a systematic use of the computer
software. Speed ratio, transmitted torque, strut geometry and friction
coefficients effect will be analysed with the output parameter variations.
Finally, the effect pulley deformable flanges will be discussed.

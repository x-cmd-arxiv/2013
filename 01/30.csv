  Evidence of tide driven filling of the inner gap in the circumbinary disk","Accepted in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/766/1/62",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  AK~Sco stands out among pre-main sequence binaries because of its prominent
ultraviolet excess, the high eccentricity of its orbit and the strong tides
driven by it. AK Sco consists of two F5 type stars that get as close as 11R$_*$
at periastron passage. The presence of a dense
  ($n_e \sim 10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$) extended envelope has been unveiled recently.
In this article, we report the results from a XMM-Newton based monitoring of
the system. We show that at periastron, X-ray and UV fluxes are enhanced
  by a factor of $\sim 3$ with respect to the apastron values. The X-ray
radiation is produced in an optically thin plasma with T$\sim 6.4\times 10^{6}$
K and it is found that the N$_H$ column density rises from 0.35$\times
10^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$ at periastron to 1.11$\times 10^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$ at apastron,
in good agreement with previous polarimetric observations. The UV emission
detected in the Optical Monitor band seems to be caused by the reprocessing of
the high energy magnetospheric radiation on the circumstellar material.
  Further evidence of the strong magnetospheric disturbances is provided by the
detection of line broadening of 278.7~km~s$^{-1}$ in the N~V line with
HST/STIS.
  Numerical simulations of the mass flow from the circumbinary disk to the
components have been carried out. They provide a consistent scenario with which
to interpret AK~Sco observations. We show that the eccentric orbit acts like a
gravitational piston. At apastron, matter is dragged efficiently from the inner
disk border, filling the inner gap and producing accretion streams that end as
ring-like structures around each component of the system. At periastron, the
ring-like structures come into contact, leading to angular momentum loss, and
thus producing an accretion outburst.

standard percolation on relative neighborhood graphs (RNGs) for planar sets of
points, considering the Euclidean metric, are put under scrutiny. RNGs belong
to the family of ``proximity graphs'', i.e. their edge-set encodes proximity
information regarding the close neighbors for the terminal nodes of a given
edge. Therefore they are, e.g., discussed in the context of the construction of
backbones for wireless ad-hoc networks that guarantee connectedness of all
underlying nodes.
  Here, by means of numerical simulations, we determine the asymptotic degree
and diameter of RNGs and we estimate their bond and site percolation
thresholds, which were previously conjectured to be nontrivial. We compare the
results to regular 2D graphs for which the degree is close to that of the RNG.
Finally, we deduce the common percolation critical exponents from the RNG data
to verify that the associated universality class is that of standard 2D
percolation.

properties of high redshift (z>6) stars through observations. Here, we discuss
one of these observables - the spectrum of the Near Infrared Background - and
how it is potentially affected by the transition from Population III to
Population II stars. The stronger Lyman-alpha emission expected from massive
Population III stars could result in a 'bump' in the spectrum of the Near
Infrared Background (referred to in this work as the Lyman-alpha bump). The
strength and shape of this bump can reveal properties of Population III stars.
The Lyman-alpha bump is predicted to be higher if Population III stars are more
massive and present at lower redshifts. The shape of the bump is governed by
the star formation rate and the time it takes Population III stars to
transition to Population II stars. If Population III stars are indeed massive,
a bump is predicted as long as Population III stars exist at z < 15, even if
their star formation rate is as low as 10^-7 M_sun yr^-1 Mpc^-3. This means
that there may be some observational signature in the Near Infrared Background
of small pockets of metal-free gas forming Population III stars at z ~ 6, even
if they are quite rare.

management is a major component in designing these schemes as it is critical
that licensed users maintain their expected quality of service. We develop a
distributed dynamic spectrum protocol in which ad-hoc device-to-device users
opportunistically access the spectrum actively in use by cellular users.
  First, channel gain estimates are used to set feasible transmit powers for
device-to-device users that keeps the interference they cause within the

route discovery packets in a random access manner to help establish either a
single-hop or multi-hop route between two device-to-device users. We show that

directly with each other instead of utilizing the cellular base station.

and organelles is anomalous, and a description simply based on the conventional
diffusion equation with diffusion constants measured in dilute solution fails.
This is commonly attributed to macromolecular crowding in the interior of cells
and in cellular membranes, summarising their densely packed and heterogeneous
structures. The most familiar phenomenon is a power-law increase of the MSD,
but there are other manifestations like strongly reduced and time-dependent
diffusion coefficients, persistent correlations, non-gaussian distributions of
the displacements, heterogeneous diffusion, and immobile particles. After a
general introduction to the statistical description of slow, anomalous
transport, we summarise some widely used theoretical models: gaussian models
like FBM and Langevin equations for visco-elastic media, the CTRW model, and
the Lorentz model describing obstructed transport in a heterogeneous
environment. Emphasis is put on the spatio-temporal properties of the transport
in terms of 2-point correlation functions, dynamic scaling behaviour, and how
the models are distinguished by their propagators even for identical MSDs.
Then, we review the theory underlying common experimental techniques in the
presence of anomalous transport: single-particle tracking, FCS, and FRAP. We
report on the large body of recent experimental evidence for anomalous
transport in crowded biological media: in cyto- and nucleoplasm as well as in
cellular membranes, complemented by in vitro experiments where model systems
mimic physiological crowding conditions. Finally, computer simulations play an
important role in testing the theoretical models and corroborating the
experimental findings. The review is completed by a synthesis of the
theoretical and experimental progress identifying open questions for future
investigation.

bulge, bar (when necessary) and disk components. To check the reliability of

objects, and optical spectra are presented for 38, including analysis of their
stellar populations using the STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code. Emission line
diagnostic-diagrams are used to discriminate between genuine AGN and HII
nuclei. Combining our observations with those found in the literature, we have
a total of 40 SEDs. It is found that about 40\%\ of the SEDs are characterized
by an upturn in the near-IR, which we have quantified as a NIR slope $\alpha <
1$ for an SED characterized as $\lambda f_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^{\alpha}$.
Three objects with an HII nucleus and two Seyfert nuclei with strong
contamination from a circumnuclear starburst, also show an upturn. For genuine
AGN this component could be explained as emission from the accretion disk, a
jet, or from a very hot dust component leaking from the central region through
a clumpy obscuring structure. The presence of a very compact nuclear starburst
as the origin for this NIR excess emission is not favored by our spectroscopic
data for these objects.

is difficult to estimate numerically a systematic uncertainty in R0 due to the
bandwagon effect; however, it is highly probable that, even if widely accepted
values differ appreciably from the true value, the published results should
eventually approach the true value despite the bandwagon effect. This should be
manifest as a trend in the published R0 data: if this trend is statistically
significant, the presence of the bandwagon effect can be suspected in the data.
Fifty two determinations of R0 published over the last 20 years were analyzed.
These data reveal no statistically significant trend, suggesting they are
unlikely to involve any systematic uncertainty due to the bandwagon effect. At
the same time, the published data show a gradual and statistically significant
decrease in the uncertainties in the R0 determinations with time.

using a toy Lagrangian that corresponds to an arbitrary spin state. In this

information in a variety of applications. However, if the graph dataset
contains sensitive data of individuals such as mobile phone-call graphs and
web-click graphs, releasing discovered frequent patterns may present a threat
to the privacy of individuals. {\em Differential privacy} has recently emerged
as the {\em de facto} standard for private data analysis due to its provable
privacy guarantee. In this paper we propose the first differentially private
algorithm for mining frequent graph patterns.
  We first show that previous techniques on differentially private discovery of
frequent {\em itemsets} cannot apply in mining frequent graph patterns due to
the inherent complexity of handling structural information in graphs. We then
address this challenge by proposing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
based algorithm. Unlike previous work on frequent itemset mining, our
techniques do not rely on the output of a non-private mining algorithm.
Instead, we observe that both frequent graph pattern mining and the guarantee
of differential privacy can be unified into an MCMC sampling framework. In
addition, we establish the privacy and utility guarantee of our algorithm and
propose an efficient neighboring pattern counting technique as well.
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to output
frequent patterns with good precision.

thermalized hard disks indicate that the curves of pressure versus packing
fraction for different polydispersities exhibit a sequence of transition
points, starting with a liquid-hexatic transition for the monodisperse case,
and crossing over with increasing polydispersity to glassy, Ising-like critical
points. I propose to explain these observations by assuming that glass-forming
fluids contain twofold degenerate, locally ordered clusters of particles,
similar to the two-state systems that have been invoked to explain other glassy
phenomena. This paper starts with a brief statistical derivation of the
thermodynamics of thermalized, hard-core particles. It then discusses how a
two-state, Ising-like model can be described within that framework in terms of
a small number of statistically relevant, internal state variables. The

disks where \sigmagas >~ 10^4 Msun pc-2}, we compute 132 Eddington-limited
star-forming disk models with radii spanning tens to hundreds of parsecs. The
theoretically expected slopes (approx. 1 for the KS law and approx. 0.5 for the
ES relation) are relatively robust to spatial averaging over the disks.
However, the star formation laws exhibit a strong dependence on opacity that
separates the models by the dust-to-gas ratio that may lead to the appearance
of a erroneously large slope. The total infrared luminosity (L_TIR) and
multiple carbon monoxide (CO) line intensities were computed for each model.
While L_TIR can yield an estimate of the average \sigmastar\ that is correct to
within a factor of 2, the velocity-integrated CO line intensity is a poor proxy
for the average \sigmagas\ for these warm and dense disks, making the CO
conversion factor (\alpha_CO) all but useless. Thus, observationally derived KS
and ES laws at these values of \sigmagas\ that uses any transition of CO will
provide a poor measurement of the underlying star formation relation. Studies
of the star formation laws of Eddington-limited disks will require a high-J
transition of a high density molecular tracer, as well as a sample of galaxies
with known metallicity estimates.

the shear direction. In such a circumstance, subdiffusion regime is predominant
perpendicular to the flow. We show that superdiffusion is a result of
accelerated chaotic motions of protein--lipid complexes within the membrane

that forms the transformation matrix, and an adaptive reduced-rank filter that
operates at the output of the bank of filters to estimate the desired signal.
We describe the proposed scheme for both the direct-form processor (DFP) and
the generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) structures. For each structure, we
derive stochastic gradient (SG) and recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms
for its adaptive implementation. The Gram-Schmidt (GS) technique is applied to
the adaptive algorithms for reformulating the transformation matrix and
improving performance. An automatic rank selection technique is developed and
employed to determine the most adequate rank for the derived algorithms. The
complexity and convexity analyses are carried out. Simulation results show that
the proposed algorithms outperform the existing full-rank and reduced-rank
methods in convergence and tracking performance.

Bekenstein entropy. In this paper, we expand on that argument, with attention
to different causal types of boundaries. This property of the GR action may
open a new approach to the puzzles of gravitational entropy. In particular, the
imaginary action can be evaluated for non-stationary finite regions, where the
notion of entropy is not fully understood. As a first step in constructing the
precise relationship between the imaginary action and entropy, we focus on
stationary black hole spacetimes. There, we identify a class of bounded regions
for which the action's imaginary part precisely equals the black hole entropy.
As a powerful test on the validity of the approach, we also calculate the
imaginary action for Lovelock gravity. The result is related to the
corresponding entropy formula in the same way as in GR.

to further constrain the SEDs after careful subtraction of a starburst
component. We use the library of CLUMPY torus models from Nenkova et
al.~(2008ab) and also test the two-phase models recently produced by Stalevski
et al.~(2012). We find that photometric and spectroscopic observations in the
mid-IR (>5mu) are crucial to properly constrain the best-fit torus models.
About half of our sources show clear near-IR excess of their SEDs above the
best fit models. This problem can be less severe when using the Stalevski et
al.~(2012) models. It is not clear what is the nature of this emission since
best fitted black body temperatures are very high (~1700-2500 K) and the Type
II classification of our sources would correspond to a small probability to
peer directly into the hottest regions of the torus. Crucially, the derived
torus parameters when using CLUMPY models are quite robust,, independently of
whether the sources require an additional black body component or not. Our
findings suggest that tori are characterized by N_0 > 5, sigma > 40, tau < 25,
i > 40 degrees, Y < 50 and A_v^los ~ 100-300. From these we can determine that
typical torus sizes and masses of 0.1-5.0 pc and 10^{4-6} M_\odot. We find
tentative evidence that those nuclei with a detected Hidden Broad Line Regions
are characterized by lower levels of extinction than those without one.
Finally, we find no correlation between the torus properties and the presence
of circumnuclear or more global star-formation.

radiation storm level. In about 20 minutes after the X-ray emission, the solar
particles reached the Earth.It was the source of the first (since December

space-borne detectors (GOES, ACE), ground based neutron monitors (Oulu) and air

combination of two factors, the low energy threshold of the Tupi muon

population of massive galaxies at z>3 to identify the potential progenitors of
z~2 compact, massive, quiescent (CMQ) galaxies, furthering our understanding of
the evolution of massive galaxies. Our work is enabled by high-resolution
CANDELS images and accurate photometric redshifts, stellar masses and star
formation rates (SFRs) from 37-band NMBS photometry. The total number of z>3
massive galaxies is consistent with the number of massive quiescent (MQ)
galaxies at z~2, implying that the SFRs for all of these galaxies must be much
lower by z~2. We discover 4 CMQ galaxies at z>3, pushing back the time for
which such galaxies have been observed. However, the volume density for these
galaxies is significantly less than that of galaxies at z<2 with similar
masses, SFRs, and sizes, implying that additional CMQ galaxies must be created
in the ~1 Gyr between z=3 and z=2. We find 5 star-forming galaxies at z~3 that
are compact (Re<1.4 kpc) and have stellar mass M*>10^(10.6)Msun, likely to
become members of the CMQ galaxy population at z~2. We evolve the stellar
masses and SFRs of each individual z>3 galaxy adopting 5 different star
formation histories (SFHs) and studying the resulting population of massive
galaxies at z=2.3. We find that declining or truncated SFHs are necessary to
match the observed number density of MQ galaxies at z~2, whereas a constant SFH
results in a number density significantly smaller than observed. All of our
assumed SFHs imply number densities of CMQ galaxies at z~2 that are consistent
with the observed number density. Better agreement with the observed number
density of CMQ galaxies at z~2 is obtained if merging is included in the
analysis and better still if star formation quenching is assumed to shortly
follow the merging event, as implied by recent models of formation of MQ
galaxies.

have shown strong evidence of IMF variations with galaxy velocity dispersion,
with a corresponding impact on other stellar population parameters, line
indices and colours. Using a set of stellar population models with varying IMF
slopes, we provide additional caveats on the assumption of a universal IMF. The
present study shows that the derived star formation histories of early-type
galaxies vary significantly with the IMF slope. For instance, a steepening in
the slope of a single power-law IMF decreases substantially, by a factor of up
to four, the contribution of the old stellar populations to the total
light/mass. This trend is milder for a segmented-like IMF shape, where the
contribution of the very low mass stars is decreased. It is also shown that, by
tuning each IMF slope to its prescribed value according to each galaxy velocity
dispersion, a sample of early-type galaxies covering a range of masses yield
comparable star formation histories. On the one hand, a small contribution from
relatively young stellar populations appear in the star formation histories of
most massive elliptical galaxies when adopting a steep IMF. On the other hand,
we find that low mass early-type galaxies that look like genuinely young
objects with a standard IMF (i.e. ``baby elliptical galaxies``), turn out to be
older when a slightly flatter IMF is employed. In summary, the use of a
non-universal IMF, tuned according to the velocity dispersion of the galaxy,
seems to provide more consistent results.

For both the leading and the trailing tail, we trace the points of their
maximal extent, or apo-centric distances, and find that they lie at $R^L$ =

preserves all the crucial elements of strongly interacting QCD, including

We then identify the non-propagating auxiliary topological field of the BF

elliptic partial differential equations of the form $\Delta u + f_s(u) = 0$,
where $f_s$ is a one-parameter family of nonlinear functions and $\Omega$ is a
domain in $R^d$. The main achievement of this paper is the approximation of
solutions to the PDE on the cube $\Omega=(0,\pi)^3 \subseteq R^3$. There are
323 possible isotropy subgroups of functions on the cube, which fall into 99
conjugacy classes. The bifurcations with symmetry in this problem are quite
interesting, including many with 3-dimensional critical eigenspaces. Our
automated symmetry analysis is necessary with so many isotropy subgroups and
bifurcations among them, and it allows our code to follow one branch in each
equivalence class that is created at a bifurcation point. Our most complicated
result is the complete analysis of a degenerate bifurcation with a
6-dimensional critical eigenspace.
  This article extends the authors' work in {\it Automated Bifurcation Analysis
for Nonlinear Elliptic Partial Difference Equations on Graphs} (Int. J. of
Bifurcation and Chaos, 2009), wherein they combined symmetry analysis with
modified implementations of the gradient Newton-Galerkin algorithm (GNGA,
Neuberger and Swift) to automatically generate bifurcation diagrams and
solution graphics for small, discrete problems with large symmetry groups. The
code described in the current paper is efficiently implemented in parallel,
allowing us to investigate a relatively fine-mesh discretization of the cube.
We use the methodology and corresponding library presented in our paper {\it An
MPI Implementation of a Self-Submitting Parallel Job Queue} (Int. J. of
Parallel Prog., 2012).

observations of the BL Lac object S50716+714 carried out between April 2007 and
January 2011. The multi-frequency observations were obtained using several
ground and space based facilities. The intense optical monitoring of the source
reveals faster repetitive variations superimposed on a long-term variability
trend at a time scale of ~350 days. Episodes of fast variability recur on time
scales of ~ 60-70 days. The intense and simultaneous activity at optical and
gamma-ray frequencies favors the SSC mechanism for the production of the
high-energy emission. Two major low-peaking radio flares were observed during
this high optical/gamma-ray activity period. The radio flares are characterized
by a rising and a decaying stage and are in agreement with the formation of a
shock and its evolution. We found that the evolution of the radio flares
requires a geometrical variation in addition to intrinsic variations of the
source. Different estimates yield a robust and self-consistent lower limits of
\delta > 20 and equipartition magnetic field B_eq > 0.36 G. Causality arguments
constrain the size of emission region \theta < 0.004 mas. We found a
significant correlation between flux variations at radio frequencies with those
at optical and gamma-rays. The optical/GeV flux variations lead the radio
variability by ~65 days. The longer time delays between low-peaking radio
outbursts and optical flares imply that optical flares are the precursors of
radio ones. An orphan X-ray flare challenges the simple, one-zone emission
models, rendering them too simple. Here we also describe the spectral energy
distribution modeling of the source from simultaneous data taken through
different activity periods.

a forum for the presentation and discussion of advances in stellar and solar
astrophysics recently (or soon to be) enabled by the latest generation of
state-of-the-art observational facilities operating from meter to submillimeter
wavelengths. The meeting brought together both observers and theorists to
discuss how radio wavelength observations are providing new and unique insights
into the workings of stars and their role in the Galactic ecosystem. Topics
covered included radio emission from hot and cool stars (from the pre- to
post-main-sequence), the Sun as a radio star, circumstellar chemistry,
planetary nebulae, white dwarf binaries and novae, supernova progenitors, and
radio stars as probes of the Galaxy.

independent synchronized sources is a challenging task of quantum electronics,
in particular regarding its application for quantum information processing.
Using two independent on-demand electron sources, we trigger the emission of
two single-electron wavepackets at different inputs of an electronic
beamsplitter. Whereas classical particles would be randomly partitioned by the
splitter, we observe two-particle interferences resulting from quantum
exchange. Both electrons, emitted in indistinguishable wavepackets with
synchronized arrival time on the splitter, exit in different outputs as
recorded by the low frequency current noise. The demonstration of two-electron
interference provides the possibility to manipulate coherent and
indistinguishable single-electron wavepackets in quantum conductors.

boundary thickness with the square root of the wind Reynolds number, to fix the
Reynolds number dependence. Meanwhile the theory is on one hand well confirmed
through various new experiments and numerical simulations. On the other hand
these new data points provide the basis for an updated fit in a much larger
parameter space. Here we pick four well established (and sufficiently distant)
Nu(Ra,Pr) data points and show that the resulting Nu(Ra,Pr) function is in
agreement with almost all established experimental and numerical data up to the
ultimate regime of thermal convection, whose onset also follows from the
theory. One extra Re(Ra,Pr) data point is used to fix Re(Ra,Pr). As Re can
depend on the definition and the aspect ratio the transformation properties of

easily be adapted to new Reynolds number data while keeping Nu(Ra,Pr)

find that the emission extends past the nominal edge of this wedge due to

shortest baselines. Finally, we filter the data to retain only this ""unsmooth""

an excess of power at the lowest modes, but no emission can be clearly
localized to any one region of the sky. This image is highly suggestive that

location of the destination node, or for service discovery. Being such a basic
operation of the networking protocols, the importance of efficient broadcasting
has long been recognized by the networking community. Numerous papers proposed
increasingly more efficient implementation of broadcasting, while other studies
presented bounds on broadcast performance. In this work, we present a new
approach to efficient broadcast in networks with dynamic topologies, such as
MANET, and we introduce a new broadcasting algorithm for such networking
environments. We evaluate our algorithm, showing that its performance comes
remarkably close to the corresponding theoretical performance bounds, even in
the presence of packet loss due to, for example, MAC-layer collisions.
Furthermore, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other
recently proposed schemes, including in various mobility settings.

Magellanic Cloud PNe with either C-rich or O-rich gas-phase compositions. We
identify for the first time in M1-11 spectral lines at 8.5 (blended with PAH),
17.3, and 18.9 um that we attribute to the C60 fullerene. This identification
is strengthened by the fact that other Galactic PNe in which fullerenes are
detected, have similar central stars, similar gas-phase abundances, and a
similar dust composition to M1-11. The weak radiation field due to the
relatively cool central stars in these PNe may provide favorable conditions for
fullerenes to survive in the circumstellar medium. Using the photo-ionization
code CLOUDY, combined with a modified blackbody, we have fitted the ~0.1-90 um

~3.5x10^{-4} Msun$. Our chemical abundance analysis and SED model suggest that
M1-11 is perhaps a C-rich PN with C/O ratio in the gas-phase of +0.19 dex, and

Hilbert-Burch matrix for the row vector [h1,h2,h3]. So, phi is a 3 by 2 matrix
of homogeneous forms from R; the entries in column m have degree dm, with d1
\le d2 and d1+d2=d. The Rees algebra $cal R$ of I is the subring k[h1t,h2t,h3t]
of the polynomial ring k[t]. The bi-projective spectrum of $cal R$ is the graph
of the parameterization of C; and therefore, there is a dictionary which
translates between the singularities of C and the algebra structure of $cal R$.
The ring $cal R$ is the quotient of the symmetric algebra Sym(I) by the ideal,
A, of local cohomology with support in the homogeneous maximal ideal of R. The
ideal A_{\ge d2-1}, which is an approximation of A, can be calculated using
linkage. We exploit the bi-graded structure of Sym(I) in order to describe the
structure of an improved approximation A_{\ge d1-1} when $d1<d2$ and phi has a
generalized zero in its first column. (The later condition is equivalent to
assuming that C has a singularity of multiplicity d2.) In particular, we give
the bi-degrees of a minimal bi-homogeneous generating set for this ideal. When
2=d1<d2 and phi has a generalized zero in its first column, then we record
explicit generators for A. When d1=d2, we provide a translation between the
bi-degrees of a bi-homogeneous minimal generating set for A_{d1-2} and the
number of singularities of multiplicity d1 which are on or infinitely near C.
We conclude with a table which translates between the bi-degrees of a
bi-homogeneous minimal generating set for A and the configuration of

viva and potentia absoluta (or work). Their mutual conversions are rarely
explicitly mentionned in this book, except once, in the Section X of his work,
from vis viva to work, and subordinated to the mediation of a machine, in a
driving forces substitution problem. His attitude significantly evolved in a
text in 1753, in which work and vis viva were unambiguously connected, while
the concept of potentia absoluta was reduced to the one of men's work, and the
expression itself was abandoned. It was then accepted that work can be
converted into vis viva, but the opposite is true in only one case, the
intra-organic one. The concept of tiredness, seen as an expenditure of animal
spirits conceived themselves as little tensed springs liberating vis viva,
allowed direct conversion, even never quantified and listed simply as a model,
from vis viva to work. Thus, work may have ultimately appeared as a
transitional state between two kinds of vis viva, which the first is
non-quantifiable. At the same time, natural elements were discredited from any
hint of profitable production. Only men and animals were able to work in the
strict sense of the word. Nature did not work by itself, according to
Bernoulli. Despite his will to bring together rational mechanics and common
mechanics, one perceived in the work of Bernoulli the subsistence of a rarely
crossed disjunction between practical and theoretical fields.

introduce the interrelated replica and cavity methods, which originated in
statistical physics as powerful ways to quantitatively analyze large highly
heterogeneous systems of many interacting degrees of freedom. We also introduce
the closely related notion of message passing in graphical models, which
originated in computer science as a distributed algorithm capable of solving
large inference and optimization problems involving many coupled variables. We
then show how both the statistical physics and computer science perspectives
can be applied in a wide diversity of contexts to problems arising in
theoretical neuroscience and data analysis. Along the way we discuss spin
glasses, learning theory, illusions of structure in noise, random matrices,
dimensionality reduction, and compressed sensing, all within the unified
formalism of the replica method. Moreover, we review recent conceptual
connections between message passing in graphical models, and neural computation

meet. This task is known in the literature as rendezvous. Each agent has a
different label which is a positive integer known to it, but unknown to the
other agent. Agents move in an asynchronous way: the speed of agents may vary
and is controlled by an adversary. The cost of a rendezvous algorithm is the
total number of edge traversals by both agents until their meeting. The only
previous deterministic algorithm solving this problem has cost exponential in

deterministic rendezvous algorithm with cost polynomial in the size of the

exponentially in the size of the graph and doubly exponentially in the labels

fundamental problems involving teams of unknown size larger than 1 of labeled
agents moving asynchronously in unknown networks. Among them are the following
problems: team size, in which every agent has to find the total number of
agents, leader election, in which all agents have to output the label of a
single agent, perfect renaming in which all agents have to adopt new different

gossiping, in which each agent has initially a piece of information (value) and

and spectroscopic survey, using the AAOmega spectrograph on the
Anglo-Australian Telescope to obtain spectra for up to ~300000 galaxies over
280 square degrees, to a limiting magnitude of r_pet < 19.8 mag. The target
galaxies are distributed over 0<z<0.5 with a median redshift of z~0.2, although
the redshift distribution includes a small number of systems, primarily
quasars, at higher redshifts, up to and beyond z=1. The redshift accuracy
ranges from sigma_v~50km/s to sigma_v~100km/s depending on the signal-to-noise
of the spectrum. Here we describe the GAMA spectroscopic reduction and analysis
pipeline. We present the steps involved in taking the raw two-dimensional
spectroscopic images through to flux-calibrated one-dimensional spectra. The
resulting GAMA spectra cover an observed wavelength range of 3750<lambda<8850 A
at a resolution of R~1300. The final flux calibration is typically accurate to
10-20%, although the reliability is worse at the extreme wavelength ends, and
poorer in the blue than the red. We present details of the measurement of
emission and absorption features in the GAMA spectra. These measurements are
characterised through a variety of quality control analyses detailing the
robustness and reliability of the measurements. We illustrate the quality of
the measurements with a brief exploration of elementary emission line
properties of the galaxies in the GAMA sample. We demonstrate the luminosity
dependence of the Balmer decrement, consistent with previously published
results, and explore further how Balmer decrement varies with galaxy mass and
redshift. We also investigate the mass and redshift dependencies of the

initial mass function (IMF) in star-forming disk galaxies by using
chemodynamical simulations with an IMF model depending both on local densities
and metallicities ([Fe/H]) of the interstellar medium (ISM). We find that the
slope (alpha) of a power-law IMF (N(m) ~ m^-alpha) for stellar masses larger
than 1M_sun evolves from the canonical Salpeter IMF (alpha ~ 2.35) to be
moderately top-heavy one (alpha ~ 1.9) in the simulated disk galaxies with
starbursts triggered by galaxy interaction. We also find that alpha in
star-forming regions correlates with star formation rate densities (Sigma_SFR
in units of M_sun yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}). Feedback effects of Type Ia and II
supernovae are found to prevent IMFs from being too top-heavy (alpha < 1.5).
The simulation predicts alpha ~ 0.23 log Sigma_SFR + 1.7 for log Sigma_SFR > -2
(i.e., more top-heavy in higher Sigma_SFR), which is reasonably consistent well
with corresponding recent observational results. The present study also
predicts that inner regions of starburst disk galaxies have smaller alpha thus
are more top-heavy (d alpha/d R ~ 0.07 kpc^{-1} for R < 5 kpc). The predicted
radial alpha gradient can be tested against future observational studies of the
alpha variation in star-forming galaxies.

and pairs) has on galaxies with stellar mass similar to the Milky-Way (L*
galaxies). A volume limited sample of 6,150 galaxies is classified to determine
emission features, morphological type and presence of a disk. This sample
allows for characteristics of galaxies to be isolated (e.g. stellar mass and
group halo mass), and their codependencies determined.
  We observe that galaxy-galaxy interactions play the most important role in
shaping the evolution within a group halo, the main role of halo mass is in
gathering the galaxies together to encourage such interactions. Dominant pair
galaxies find their overall star formation enhanced when the pair's mass ratio
is close to 1, otherwise we observe the same galaxies as we would in an
unpaired system. The minor galaxy in a pair is greatly affected by its
companion galaxy, and whilst the star forming fraction is always suppressed
relative to equivalent stellar mass unpaired galaxies, it becomes lower still
when the mass ratio of a pair system increases.
  We find that, in general, the close galaxy-galaxy interaction rate drops as a
function of halo mass for a given amount of stellar mass. We find evidence of a
local peak of interactions for Milky-Way stellar mass galaxies in Milky-Way
halo mass groups. Low mass halos, and in particular Local Group mass halos, are
an important environment for understanding the typical evolutionary path of a

  We find compelling evidence for galaxy conformity in both groups and pairs,
where morphological type conformity is dominant in groups, and emission class
conformity is dominant in pairs. This suggests that group scale conformity is
the result of many galaxy encounters over an extended period of time, whilst
pair conformity is a fairly instantaneous response to a transitory interaction.

symmetry (1) on the neutrino mass matrix {\cal M}_{\nu f} in the flavour basis
(2) simultaneously on the charged lepton mass matrix M_l and the neutrino mass
matrix M_\nu and (3) on the underlying Lagrangian is discussed in the light of
recent observation of a non-zero reactor mixing angle \theta_{13}. In case (1),
\mu-\tau symmetry breaking may be regarded as small (less than 20-30%) only for
the inverted or quasidegenerate neutrino mass spectrum and the normal hierarchy
would violate it by a large amount. The case (2) is more restrictive and the
requirement of relatively small breaking allows only the quasidegenerate
spectrum. If neutrinos obtain their masses from the type-I seesaw mechanism
then small breaking of the \mu-\tau symmetry in the underlying Lagrangian may
result in a large breaking in {\cal M}_{\nu f} and even the hierarchical
neutrino spectrum may also be consistent with mildly broken \mu-\tau symmetry
of the Lagrangian. Neutrinoless double beta decay provides a good means of
distinguishing above scenarios. In particular, non-observation of signal in
future experiments such as GERDA would rule out scenarios (1) and (2).

system utilizing the distance distributions presented in a previous
publication. These distances make use of the unique combination of depth and
spatial coverage of the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) to provide
a large, homogeneous sample consisting of 27 of M31's satellites, as well as
M31 itself. We find that the satellite distribution, when viewed as a whole, is
no more planar than one would expect from a random distribution of equal size.
A disk consisting of 15 of the satellites is however found to be highly
significant, and strikingly thin, with a root-mean-square thickness of just
$12.34^{+0.75}_{-0.43}$ kpc. This disk is oriented approximately edge on with
respect to the Milky Way and almost perpendicular to the Milky Way disk. It is
also roughly orthogonal to the disk like structure regularly reported for the
Milky Way satellite system and in close alignment with M31's Giant Stellar
Stream. A similar analysis of the asymmetry of the M31 satellite distribution
finds that it is also significantly larger than one would expect from a random
distribution. In particular, it is remarkable that 20 of the 27 satellites most
likely lie on the Milky Way side of the galaxy, with the asymmetry being most
pronounced within the satellite subset forming the aforementioned disk. This
lopsidedness is all the more intriguing in light of the apparent orthogonality
observed between the satellite disk structures of the Milky Way and M31.

is convergent can be well described and that the long-range interaction,
anomalous diffusion, and q-Gaussian type distribution of complex systems can
also be well described by the interaction parameters in different cases. In

cluster population has ages ranging from 100 Myr to 1 Gyr, with a peak at about
500 Myr. This suggests that M82 has undergone a disk-wide star formation about
500 Myr ago, probably through the interaction with M81. The brightest star
clusters in the nuclear region are much brighter than those in other regions,
indicating that more massive star clusters are formed in the denser
environments. On the other hand, the colors of the halo clusters are similar to
those of globular clusters in the Milky Way Galaxy, and their ages are

axis-aligned boxes in d-space. Omitting logarithmic factors, the best algorithm
has runtime O*(n^{d/2}) [Overmars,Yap'91]. There are faster algorithms known
for several special cases: Cube-KMP (where all boxes are cubes), Unitcube-KMP
(where all boxes are cubes of equal side length), Hypervolume (where all boxes
share a vertex), and k-Grounded (where the projection onto the first k
dimensions is a Hypervolume instance).
  In this paper we bring some order to these special cases by providing
reductions among them. In addition to the trivial inclusions, we establish
Hypervolume as the easiest of these special cases, and show that the runtimes
of Unitcube-KMP and Cube-KMP are polynomially related. More importantly, we
show that any algorithm for one of the special cases with runtime T(n,d)
implies an algorithm for the general case with runtime T(n,2d), yielding the
first non-trivial relation between KMP and its special cases. This allows to
transfer W[1]-hardness of KMP to all special cases, proving that no n^{o(d)}
algorithm exists for any of the special cases under reasonable complexity
theoretic assumptions. Furthermore, assuming that there is no improved
algorithm for the general case of KMP (no algorithm with runtime O(n^{d/2 -
eps})) this reduction shows that there is no algorithm with runtime
O(n^{floor(d/2)/2 - eps}) for any of the special cases. Under the same
assumption we show a tight lower bound for a recent algorithm for 2-Grounded

no greater than that of the rotation number. The proof is based on the

of the predictor variable that enters the current lasso model, in the sequence
of models visited along the lasso solution path. We propose a simple test
statistic based on lasso fitted values, called the covariance test statistic,
and show that when the true model is linear, this statistic has an
$\operatorname {Exp}(1)$ asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis (the
null being that all truly active variables are contained in the current lasso
model). Our proof of this result for the special case of the first predictor to
enter the model (i.e., testing for a single significant predictor variable
against the global null) requires only weak assumptions on the predictor matrix
$X$. On the other hand, our proof for a general step in the lasso path places
further technical assumptions on $X$ and the generative model, but still allows
for the important high-dimensional case $p>n$, and does not necessarily require
that the current lasso model achieves perfect recovery of the truly active
variables. Of course, for testing the significance of an additional variable
between two nested linear models, one typically uses the chi-squared test,
comparing the drop in residual sum of squares (RSS) to a $\chi^2_1$
distribution. But when this additional variable is not fixed, and has been
chosen adaptively or greedily, this test is no longer appropriate: adaptivity
makes the drop in RSS stochastically much larger than $\chi^2_1$ under the null
hypothesis. Our analysis explicitly accounts for adaptivity, as it must, since
the lasso builds an adaptive sequence of linear models as the tuning parameter
$\lambda$ decreases. In this analysis, shrinkage plays a key role: though
additional variables are chosen adaptively, the coefficients of lasso active
variables are shrunken due to the $\ell_1$ penalty. Therefore, the test
statistic (which is based on lasso fitted values) is in a sense balanced by
these two opposing properties - adaptivity and shrinkage - and its null
distribution is tractable and asymptotically $\operatorname {Exp}(1)$.

provide detailed electronic traces of these communications between individuals.
These electronic traces indicate that the interactions occur in temporal
bursts. Here, we study the inter-call durations of the 100,000 most-active
cellphone users of a Chinese mobile phone operator. We confirm that the
inter-call durations follow a power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff
at the population level but find differences when focusing on individual users.
We apply statistical tests at the individual level and find that the inter-call
durations follow a power-law distribution for only 3460 individuals (3.46%).
The inter-call durations for the majority (73.34%) follow a Weibull
distribution. We quantify individual users using three measures: out-degree,
percentage of outgoing calls, and communication diversity. We find that the
cellphone users with a power-law duration distribution fall into three
anomalous clusters: robot-based callers, telecom frauds, and telephone sales.
This information is of interest to both academics and practitioners, mobile

Weibull duration distribution form the fourth cluster of ordinary cellphone
users. We also discover more information about the calling patterns of these
four clusters, e.g., the probability that a user will call the $c_r$-th most
contact and the probability distribution of burst sizes. Our findings may
enable a more detailed analysis of the huge body of data contained in the logs

unsatisfactory for at least three reasons: there is no clear expansion
parameter since the density contrast is not small on all scales; it does not
fully account for deviations at large scales from a perfect pressureless fluid
induced by short-scale non-linearities; for generic initial conditions, loop
corrections are UV-divergent, making predictions cutoff dependent and hence
unphysical. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures successfully
addresses all three issues. Here we focus on the third one and show explicitly
that the terms induced by integrating out short scales, neglected in SPT, have
exactly the right scale dependence to cancel all UV-divergences at one loop,
and this should hold at all loops. A particularly clear example is an Einstein
deSitter universe with no-scale initial conditions P_in=A k^n. After
renormalizing the theory, we use self-similarity to derive a very simple result
for the final power spectrum for any n, excluding two-loop corrections and
higher. We show how the relative importance of different corrections depend on
n. For n=-1.5, relevant for our universe, pressure and dissipative corrections

limited, holding back attempts to understand this co-evolution. Directly
measuring black-hole masses is currently possible with stellar kinematics (in
early-type galaxies), ionised-gas kinematics (in some spiral and early-type
galaxies) and in rare objects which have central maser emission. Here we report
that by modelling the effect of a black-hole on the kinematics of molecular gas
it is possible to fit interferometric observations of CO emission and thereby
accurately estimate black hole masses. We study the dynamics of the gas in the
early-type galaxy NGC4526, and obtain a best fit which requires the presence of
a central dark-object of 4.5(+4.2-3.0)x10^8 Msun (3 sigma confidence limit).
With next generation mm-interferometers (e.g. ALMA) these observations could be
reproduced in galaxies out to 75 megaparsecs in less the 5 hours of observing
time. The use of molecular gas as a kinematic tracer should thus allow one to
estimate black-hole masses in hundreds of galaxies in the local universe, many
more than accessible with current techniques.

Therefore, the nuclear physics underlying Big Bang Li-6 production must be

neurons with short-term depressing synapses form unidirectional pairwise
connections. The cause of these structural differences in synaptic
microcircuits is unknown. We propose that these connectivity motifs emerge from
the interactions between short-term synaptic dynamics (SD) and long-term
spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). While the impact of STDP on SD was
shown in vitro, the mutual interactions between STDP and SD in large networks
are still the subject of intense research. We formulate a computational model
by combining SD and STDP, which captures faithfully short- and long-term
dependence on both spike times and frequency. As a proof of concept, we
simulate recurrent networks of spiking neurons with random initial connection
efficacies and where synapses are either all short-term facilitating or all
depressing. For identical background inputs, and as a direct consequence of
internally generated activity, we find that networks with depressing synapses
evolve unidirectional connectivity motifs, while networks with facilitating
synapses evolve reciprocal connectivity motifs. This holds for heterogeneous
networks including both facilitating and depressing synapses. Our study
highlights the conditions under which SD-STDP might the correlation between
facilitation and reciprocal connectivity motifs, as well as between depression
and unidirectional motifs. We further suggest experiments for the validation of
the proposed mechanism.

element ratios follow a normal pattern, but 10-15% of the stars are enhanced in
heavy neutron-capture (r- or s-processes) elements by large factors, and about
20% are strongly enriched in carbon. The enhancement of some elements could be
the result of highly non-spherical supernova and inefficient mixing in the
early interstellar medium. Alternative, they could be due to mass transfer from
a former AGB or supernova binary companion that has now evolved to a white
dwarf or neutron star. If the latter explanation is true we can detect these
stars as long-period binaries. Radial velocity monitoring over a period of ~5
years of a sample of EMP stars with either r-process element and/or carbon
enhancement is presented. The results indicate that pure r-process and carbon
enhancements are not results of mass transfer from a binary companion.

comprehensive ongoing study to search for and to analyze planetary nebulae

sdOs with a post-AGB origin. We use deep Halpha and [OIII] images of sdOs to
detect nebular emission and intermediate resolution, long-slit optical
spectroscopy of the detected nebulae and their sdO central stars. These data
are complemented with other observations for further analysis of the detected
nebulae. We report the detection of an extremely faint, complex PN around 2MASS
J19310888+4324577 (2M1931+4324), a star classified as sdO in a binary system.
The PN shows a bipolar and an elliptical shell, whose major axes are oriented
perpendicular to each other, and high-excitation structures outside the two
shells. WISE archive images show faint, extended emission at 12 and 22 microns
in the inner nebular regions. The internal nebular kinematics is consistent
with a bipolar and a cylindrical/ellipsoidal shell, in both cases with the main
axis mainly perpendicular to the line of sight. The nebular spectrum only
exhibits Halpha, Hbeta and [OIII]4959,5007 emission lines, but suggests a very
low-excitation ([OIII]/Hbeta = 1.5), in strong contrast with the absence of
low-excitation emission lines. The spectrum of 2M1931+4324 presents narrow,
ionized helium absorptions that confirm the previous sdO classification and
suggest an effective temperature >= 60000 K. The binary nature of 2M1931+4324,

probability of overestimating the true number of change-points K is controlled
by the asymptotic null distribution of the multiscale test statistic. Further,
we derive exponential bounds for the probability of underestimating K. By
balancing these quantities, \alpha will be chosen such that the probability of
correctly estimating K is maximized. All results are even non-asymptotic for
the normal case. Based on the aforementioned bounds, we construct
asymptotically honest confidence sets for the unknown step function and its
change-points. At the same time, we obtain exponential bounds for estimating
the change-point locations which for example yield the minimax rate O(1/n) up
to a log term. Finally, SMUCE asymptotically achieves the optimal detection
rate of vanishing signals. We illustrate how dynamic programming techniques can
be employed for efficient computation of estimators and confidence regions. The
performance of the proposed multiscale approach is illustrated by simulations

much attention from the context of the origin of glassy slow dynamics.
Candidates for such structural order are icosahedral, exotic amorphous, and
crystal-like. Each type of order is linked to a different scenario of glass
transition. Here we experimentally access local structural order in
polydisperse hard spheres by particle-level confocal microscopy. We identify
the key structures as icosahedral and FCC-like order, both statistically
associated with slow particles. However, when approaching the glass transition,
the icosahedral order does not grow in size whereas crystal-like order grows.
It is the latter that governs the dynamics and is linked to dynamic
heterogeneity. This questions the direct role of the local icosahedral ordering
in glassy slow dynamics and suggests that the growing lengthscale of structural
order is essential for the slowing down of dynamics and the nonlocal
cooperativity in particle motion.

orientational order and local icosahedral order with the spatial distribution

particles are depleted and the slightly smaller size of the central particle
stabilizes icosahedral order. For the latter, on the other hand, we found that

the torsionful Levi-Civita connection associated to the generalised geometry.
As we shall see, the resulting expression not only agrees with recently
discovered local couplings on the D-brane worldvolume involving RR fields and
derivatives of the B-field, but also makes the coupling manifestly T-duality
invariant.

interference, specifically the cross network interference between the macrocell

limiting factors in allowing an underlaid femtocell network to share the
spectrum with the cellular network. To manage this interference, we first
propose a femtocell architecture that orthog- onally partitions the network
bandwidth between the macrocell and femtocell networks. This scheme eliminates
the cross network interference thus giving the femtocells more freedom over
their use of the spectrum. Specifically, no interference constraint is imposed
by the cellular network allowing femto users to transmit at a constant power on
randomly selected channels. Although simple, this scheme is enough to give
gains up to 200% in sum rate.
  We then propose a second architecture where both networks share the bandwidth
simultaneously. A femtocell power control scheme that relies on minimal
coordination with the macrocell base station is used in conjunction with an
interference sensing channel assignment mechanism. These two schemes together
yield sum rate gains up to 200%. We then develop a technique for macro users to
join a nearby femtocell and share a common chan- nel with a femtocell user
through the use of successive interfer- ence cancellation. By adding this
mechanism to the power control and channel assignment schemes, we show sum rate
gains over 300% and up to 90% power savings for macrocell users.

a proof procedure based on a refutation complete resolution-style calculus.
Recently, a syntactical extension of first order Possibilistic logic (called

proposed. Our aim is to present steps towards both the formalization of PLFC
itself and an automated deduction system for it by (i) providing a formal

(iii) describing a first-order proof procedure for PLFC clauses based on (ii)

truth-evaluation of formulas with fuzzy constants are many-valued instead of
boolean, and consequently an extended notion of possibilistic uncertainty is
also needed.

ability to reason about its current status and its future trajectory. In the
case of a stochastic system, these tasks typically involve the use of a belief
state- a probability distribution over the state of the process at a given
point in time. Unfortunately, the state spaces of complex processes are very
large, making an explicit representation of a belief state intractable. Even in
dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), where the process itself can be represented
compactly, the representation of the belief state is intractable. We
investigate the idea of maintaining a compact approximation to the true belief
state, and analyze the conditions under which the errors due to the
approximations taken over the lifetime of the process do not accumulate to make
our answers completely irrelevant. We show that the error in a belief state
contracts exponentially as the process evolves. Thus, even with multiple
approximations, the error in our process remains bounded indefinitely. We show
how the additional structure of a DBN can be used to design our approximation
scheme, improving its performance significantly. We demonstrate the
applicability of our ideas in the context of a monitoring task, showing that
orders of magnitude faster inference can be achieved with only a small

  Optical Lattice","5 papers, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.quant-gas cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the Bose-Einstein condensate in a honeycomb optical lattice within
Bogoliubov theory and find that for a ${\bf k} = 0$ condensate, the Dirac
points appear in the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum when $0 < \beta < 2$, which
illustrates that the bose-bose interaction does not change the Dirac point
structure but only give a modification of the velocity of the Dirac cone. When
the bosons are driven to condense at ${\bf k} = {\bf K}$, however, we find that
the topology of the Dirac points will be altered by arbitrary weak interaction.
Furthermore, we find that the next-nearest-neighbor hopping in an isotropic and
an anisotropic lattice has different effects to the dynamics of the condensate
and it should be taken into account when the lattice is not sufficiently deep.

  of the text",,,"ngi01","quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although gauge invariance preserves the values of physical observables, a
gauge transformation can introduce important alterations of physical
interpretations. To understand this, it is first shown that a gauge
transformation is not, in general, a unitary transformation. Also, physical
interpretations are based on both kinetic energy and potential energy
expressions. While the kinetic energy is a measurable quantity, and hence
gauge-invariant, the potential energy is gauge-dependent. Two basic examples
are examined; one classical and the other quantum-mechanical. The aim is to
show that the use of the Coulomb (or radiation) gauge is always consistent with
the way that fields are generated in the laboratory. Upon transformation out of
the Coulomb gauge, this connection is lost, and physical interpretations can
give rise to misleading inferences.

problematic paradigms can be unreasonably complex (e.g. epicycles) or simply
wrong (e.g. ultraviolet catastrophe). Supercontinent cycles, also called Wilson
cycles, are, I submit, artificial constructs, like epicycles. Here I provide
the basis for that assertion and describe published considerations from a
fundamentally different, new, indivisible geoscience paradigm which obviate the
necessity for assuming supercontinent cycles.

"1302.2572","J. Zheng-Johansson X.","J.X. Zheng-Johansson","Inference of the Universal Constancy of Planck Constant based on First
  Principles","Presentation at the International Workshop DICE, Castiglioncello
  (Tuscany), Italy, Sept, 2012",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since its discovery by Max Planck in 1900, the Planck constant $h$ has been
demonstrated to be an universal constant, and its numerical value has been
accurately determined based on experiments. Up to the present however the
physical origin of this fundamental constant has not been well understood, and
the numerical value of it has not been {\it ab initio} predicted. $h$ is
characteristic in two respects: 1) it is a universal constant with respect to
all (quasi-) stationary dynamical processes of all matter particles and
radiation fields, and 2) it has a specific numerical value. A theoretical
inference of $h$, and a corresponding accounting for the physical origin of
$h$, therefore needs be achieved in both respects. This paper presents a
theoretical exploration in the first respect, a mathematical inference of the
universal constancy of $h$, based on the second law of thermodynamics, the
principle of least action and the probability theory.

Before performing the isochrone fits, we corrected the photometric data for
differential reddening and calculated the mean ridge line of the color
magnitude diagrams. We compared the isochrones of Dartmouth Stellar Evolution
Database and PAdova and TRieste Stellar Evolution Code (with microscopic
diffusion starting on the main sequence). Based on previous determinations of
the metallicity of this cluster we test it from [Fe/H]=-1.00 to [Fe/H]= -0.50,
and the age from 9 to 13 Gyrs. The uncertainties do not decrease when we fit
simultaneous colors. We also find that the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database
isochrones have a better fit in the sub giant branch and low main sequence than
the PAdova and TRieste Stellar Evolution Code. Considering the most recent
spectroscopic determination of the metallicity ([Fe/H]= -0.67), we find
E(B-V)=0.69+/-0.02, (m-M)_V=15.02+/-0.07 and 11+/-2 Gyr for NGC 6366.

gene expression. A common limitation in experiments using these technologies is
the low number or even absence of biological replicates, which complicates the
statistical analysis of digital gene expression data. Analysis of this type of

non-parametric Bayesian approach for the analysis of digital gene expression
data. We begin with a hierarchical model for modelling over-dispersed count
data and a blocked Gibbs sampling algorithm for inferring the posterior
distribution of model parameters conditional on these counts. The algorithm
compensates for the problem of low numbers of biological replicates by
clustering together genes with tag counts that are likely sampled from a common
distribution and using this augmented sample for estimating the parameters of
this distribution. The number of clusters is not decided a priori, but it is
inferred along with the remaining model parameters. We demonstrate the ability
of this approach to model biological data with high fidelity by applying the
algorithm on a public dataset obtained from cancerous and non-cancerous neural

In stellar interiors, rotation is able to drive turbulent motions,
and the related transport processes have a significant influence on the
evolution of stars. Turbulent mixing in the radiative zones is currently taken
into account in stellar evolution models through a set of diffusion
coefficients that are generally poorly constrained.
  Aims. We want to constrain the form of one of them, the radial diffusion
coefficient of chemical elements due to the turbulence driven by radial
differential rotation, derived by Zahn (1974, 1992) on phenomenological grounds
and largely used since.
  Methods. We performed local, direct numerical simulations of stably
stratified homogeneous sheared turbulence using the Boussinesq approximation.
The domain of low P\'eclet numbers found in stellar interiors is currently
inaccessible to numerical simulations without approximation. It is explored
here thanks to a suitable asymptotic form of the Boussinesq equations. The
turbulent transport of a passive scalar is determined in statistical steady
states.
  Results. We provide a first quantitative determination of the turbulent
diffusion coefficient and find that the form proposed by Zahn is in good
agreement with the results of the numerical simulations.

linear subarrays with inter-element spacings $M\lambda/2$ and $N\lambda/2$,

estimated point in the two-dimensional plane onto one-dimensional line segments
that correspond to the entire angular domain. By doing so, we avoid the search

functional theory we have shown that the longitudinal SW defects do not open a
bandgap near the Fermi energy, while a relatively small bandgap emerges in
tubes with circumferential defects. We argue that the bandgap opening in the
presence of circumferential SW defects is a consequence of long-range symmetry
breaking which can spread all the way along the tube. Specifically, the
distribution of contracted and stretched bond lengths due to the presence of
defects, and hopping energies for low-energy electrons, i.e. the 2pz electrons,
show two different patterns for the two types of defects. Interplay between the
geometric features and the electronic properties of the tubes have also been
studied for different defect concentrations. Considering $\pi$-orbital charge
density, it has also been shown that the deviations of bond lengths from their
relaxed length result in different doping for two defect orientations around
the defects -- electron-rich for a circumferential defect and hole-rich for a
longitudinal one. We have also shown that, in the tubes having both types of
defects, circumferential defects would dominate and impose their electronic
properties.

for the interference and the nonlinear impairments is adopted, rather than a
classical predistorter at the transmitter coupled with a simpler receiver, the
benefits in terms of spectral efficiency can be even larger. Finally, we
consider practical coded schemes and show the potential advantages of the
optimized signaling formats when combined with iterative detection/decoding.

regime where the simple minded theory of the normal diffusion fails. We greatly
improve the accuracy of the numerical calculations with the following
conclusions: The level spacings distribution of the eigenphases is very well
described by the Brody distribution, systematically better than by other
proposals, for various Brody exponents. When N->infinity and L is fixed we have
always Poisson, even in fully chaotic regime. We study the eigenfunctions of
the Floquet operator and characterize their localization properties using the

equal to the Brody parameter. We show the existence of a scaling law between
the localization parameter and the scaling variable L/N, now including the

superhorizon domains of randomly varying densities when the baryon density at
initial collapse of galaxy-forming perturbations is determined by anthropic
selection. The baryon and dark matter densities are assumed to be dependent on
random variables \theta_{d} and \theta_{b} according to \rho_{dm} ~
\theta_{d}^{\alpha} and \rho_{b} ~ \theta_{b}^{\beta}, while the effectively
constant dark energy density is dependent upon a random variable \phi_{Q}

Relative abundances can still be measured accurately deep into the reionization

evolution of DLAs using a constrained model for evolution of galaxies and IGM
to determine the degree to which DLA abundance measurements can probe

is zero for z<8. Nevertheless, at high redshift (z ~ 6) Population III chemical
signatures are retained in low-mass galaxies (halo mass < 10^9 Msun). This is
because photoionization feedback suppresses star formation in these galaxies
until relatively low redshift (z ~ 10), and the chemical record of early
Population III star formation is retained. We model DLAs as these galaxies by
assigning to them a mass-dependent H I absorption cross section and predict
distribution of DLA abundance ratios. We find that these distributions are
anchored towards abundance ratios set by Population II yields, but exhibit a
tail that depends on the Population III IMF for z > 5. Thus, a sample of DLA
abundance measurements at high redshift holds the promise to constrain
Population III IMF. A sample of just 10 DLAs with relative abundances measured
to an accuracy of 0.1 dex is sufficient to constrain the Population III IMF at

metal-poor stars and individual DLAs. Our results provide a global picture of

underutilized radio spectrum. The MAC protocol in CRN defines the spectrum
usage by sharing the channels efficiently among users. In this paper we propose
a novel TDMA based MAC protocol with dynamically allocated slots. Most of the
MAC protocols proposed in the literature employ Common Control Channel (CCC) to
manage the resources among Cognitive Radio (CR) users. Control channel
saturation in case of large number of CR users is one of the main drawbacks of
the CCC based MAC protocols. In contrast with CCC based MAC protocols, DSAT-MAC
protocol is based on the TDMA mechanism, without using any CCC for control
information exchange. The channels are divided into time slots and CR users
send their control or data packets over their designated slot. The protocol
ensures that no slot is left vacant. This guarantees full use of the available
spectrum. The protocol includes the provision for Quality of Service, where
real-time and safety critical data is transmitted with highest priority and
least delay. The protocol also ensures a fair sharing of available spectrum
among the CR users, with the mechanism to regulate the transmission of
malicious nodes. Energy saving techniques are also presented for longer life of
battery operated CR nodes. Theoretical analysis and simulations over ns-2 of
the proposed protocol reveal that the protocol performs better in various CR
adhoc network applications.

translations on a space of Lipschitz functions corresponding to closed subsets
of the plane, combined with a measure-theoretical argument. We consider an
alternative dynamical approach in which the phase space is given by the set of
measurable functions from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $[0,1]$, which we view as a compact
subspace of $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ in the weak-* topology. The pointwise
ergodic theorem for $\mathbb{R}^d$-actions implies that with respect to any
translation-invariant measure on this space, almost every function is
asymptotically close to a constant function at large scales. This observation
leads to a general sufficient condition for a configuration to occur in every
set of positive upper Banach density at all sufficiently large scales,
extending a recent theorem of B. Bukh. To illustrate the use of this criterion
we apply it to prove a new result concerning three-point configurations in

star formation, feedback from supernovae (SNe) and simplified prescriptions for
galaxy merging, but no chemical evolution, disc instabilities or AGN feedback.
We run these versions on identical samples of dark matter (DM) haloes extracted
from high-resolution N-body simulations in order to perform both statistical
analysis and object-by-object comparisons. We compare our results with previous
work based on stripped-down versions of the same SAMs including only gas
cooling, and show that all feedback models provide coherent modifications in
the distribution of baryons between the various gas phases. In particular, we
find that the predicted hot gas fractions are considerably increased by up to a
factor of three, while the corresponding cold gas fractions are correspondingly
decreased, and a significant amount of mass is ejected from the DM halo.
Nonetheless, we also find relevant differences in the predicted properties of
model galaxies among the three SAMs: these deviations are more relevant at mass
scales comparable to that of our own Galaxy, and are reduced at larger masses,
confirming the varying impact of stellar feedback at different mass scales. We
also check the effect of enhanced star formation events (i.e. starbursts
modes), defined in connection with galaxy mergers. We find that, in general,
these episodes have a limited impact in the overall star formation histories of
model galaxies, even in massive DM halos where merger-driven star formation has
often been considered very important.

surprising given how fast these planets had been expected to migrate into the
star due to the tides raised on the star by planets at such close distances. It
has been seen as improbable that we would find planets in such a small final
fraction of their lives. The favored solution has been that the tidal
dissipation is much weaker than expected, which would mean that the final
infall would be a larger fraction of the planets' life. We find no reason to
exclude the explanation that a small number of planets are continuously sent
migrating inwards such that these planets indeed are in the last fraction of
their lives. Following the observation that the distribution of medium planets
disfavors tidal dissipation being significantly weaker than has been found from
observations of binary stars, we now show that the numbers of planets in such a
""flow"" of excess planets migrating inwards is low enough that even depletion of
the three-day pileup is a plausible source. Then the shortest period occurrence
distribution would be shaped by planets continuously being sent into the star,
which may explain the depletion of the pileup in the Kepler field relative to
the solar neighborhood (Howard et al. 2012, hereafter H12). Because Kepler
observes above the galactic plane, H12 suggested the Kepler field may include
an older population of stars. The tidal dissipation strength in stars due to
giant planets may be not greatly weaker than it is in binary stars.

Dirac fermions when charge conjugation and time-reversal symmetries are
preserved. Viewed as a purely 2+1d system, this surface theory would
necessarily explicitly break parity and time-reversal when coupled to a
fluctuating gauge field. Here we explain why such a state can exist on the
boundary of a 3+1d system without breaking these symmetries, even if the number
of boundary components is odd. This is accomplished from two complementary
perspectives: topological quantization conditions and regularization. We first
discuss the conditions under which (continuous) large gauge transformations may
exist when the theory lives on a boundary of a higher-dimensional spacetime.
Next, we show how the higher-dimensional bulk theory is essential in providing
a parity-invariant regularization of the theory living on the lower-dimensional
boundary or defect.

estimate the expected neutrino signal, we use the largest sample of bursts
observed by BATSE in 1991-2000. A GRB neutrino could have been detected if
IceCube+DeepCore operated at that time. Detection of 10-100 GeV neutrinos would
have significant implications, shedding light on the composition of GRB jets

Condensate (BEC) upon collision with another BEC in analogy to slowing of light

scattering length with collision energy and thereby changes the group velocity.
A generalized Gross-Pitaveskii equation is derived for a small BEC moving
through a larger stationary BEC. We denote the two condensates by laser and
medium BEC, respectively, to highlight the analogy to a laser pulse travelling
through a medium. We derive an expression for the group velocity in a
homogeneous medium as well as for the difference in distance, $\delta$, covered
by the laser BEC in the presence and absence of a finite-sized medium BEC with
a Thomas-Fermi density distribution. For a medium and laser of the same
isotopic species, the shift $\delta$ has an upper bound of twice the
Thomas-Fermi radius of the medium. For typical narrow Feshbach resonances and a
medium with number density $10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ up to 85% of the upper bound can
be achieved, making the effect experimentally observable. We also derive

of observations $n$ is smaller than the number of parameters $p$. A very
successful approach in this setting uses $\ell_1$-penalized least squares
(a.k.a. the Lasso) to search for a subset of $s_0< n$ parameters that best
explain the data, while setting the other parameters to zero. Considerable
amount of work has been devoted to characterizing the estimation and model
selection problems within this approach.
  In this paper we consider instead the fundamental, but far less understood,
question of \emph{statistical significance}. More precisely, we address the
problem of computing p-values for single regression coefficients.
  On one hand, we develop a general upper bound on the minimax power of tests
with a given significance level. On the other, we prove that this upper bound
is (nearly) achievable through a practical procedure in the case of random
design matrices with independent entries. Our approach is based on a debiasing
of the Lasso estimator. The analysis builds on a rigorous characterization of
the asymptotic distribution of the Lasso estimator and its debiased version.
Our result holds for optimal sample size, i.e., when $n$ is at least on the
order of $s_0 \log(p/s_0)$.
  We generalize our approach to random design matrices with i.i.d. Gaussian
rows $x_i\sim N(0,\Sigma)$. In this case we prove that a similar distributional
characterization (termed `standard distributional limit') holds for $n$ much
larger than $s_0(\log p)^2$.
  Finally, we show that for optimal sample size, $n$ being at least of order
$s_0 \log(p/s_0)$, the standard distributional limit for general Gaussian
designs can be derived from the replica heuristics in statistical physics.

present, in some way or another, in almost every constraint program. The
decomposition of such constraints is a standard technique for obtaining an
adequate propagation algorithm from a combination of propagators designed for
simpler constraints. The decomposition approach is appealing in several ways.
Firstly because creating a specific propagator for every constraint is clearly
infeasible since the number of constraints is infinite. Secondly, because
designing a propagation algorithm for complex constraints can be very
challenging. Finally, reusing existing propagators allows to reduce the size of
code to be developed and maintained. Traditionally, constraint solvers
automatically decompose constraints into simpler ones using additional
auxiliary variables and propagators, or expect the users to perform such
decomposition themselves, eventually leading to the same propagation model. In
this paper we explore views, an alternative way to create efficient propagators
for such constraints in a modular, simple and correct way, which avoids the

lineages within species. What is yet unclear is whether such lineages represent
nascent species or evolutionary ephemera. To address this question, we compare
five contact zones, each of which occurs between eco-morphologically cryptic
lineages of rainforest skinks from the rainforests of the Australian Wet
Tropics. Although the contacts likely formed concurrently in response to
Holocene expansion from glacial refugia, we estimate that the divergence times
(t) of the lineage-pairs range from 3.1 to 11.5 Myr. Multilocus analyses of the
contact zones yielded estimates of reproductive isolation that are tightly
correlated with divergence time and, for longer-diverged lineages (t > 5 Myr),
substantial. These results show that phylogeographic splits of increasing depth
can represent stages along the speciation continuum, even in the absence of
overt change in ecologically relevant morphology.

distribution for average local Mach number ranging from ~0.2 to ~5.5. As a
consequence of the non linear development of thermal instability (TI), the
logarithmic variance of the distribution for the diffuse gas increases with M
faster than in the well known isothermal case. The average local Mach number
for the dense gas (n >= 7.1cm^-3) goes from ~1.1 to ~16.9 and the shape of the
high density zone of the n-PDF changes from a power-law at low Mach numbers to
a lognormal at high M values. In the latter case the width of the distribution
is smaller than in the isothermal case and grows slower with M. At high column
densities the Sigma-PDF is well described by a lognormal for all the Mach
numbers we consider and, due to the presence of TI, the width of the
distribution is systematically larger than in the isothermal case but follows a
qualitatively similar behavior as M increases. Although a relationship between
the width of the distribution and M can be found for each one of the cases
mentioned above, these relations are different form those of the isothermal

an excellent method to stabilize mechanical systems in the Hamiltonian
formalism. In this paper, several improvements are made on the IDA-PBC method.
The skew-symmetric interconnection submatrix in the conventional form of
IDA-PBC is shown to have some redundancy for systems with the number of degrees
of freedom greater than two, containing unnecessary components that do not
contribute to the dynamics. To completely remove this redundancy, the use of
quadratic gyroscopic forces is proposed in place of the skew-symmetric
interconnection submatrix. Reduction of the number of matching partial
differential equations in IDA-PBC and simplification of the structure of the
matching partial differential equations are achieved by eliminating the
gyroscopic force from the matching partial differential equations. In addition,
easily verifiable criteria are provided for Lyapunov/exponential
stabilizability by IDA-PBC for all linear controlled Hamiltonian systems with
arbitrary degrees of underactuation and for all nonlinear controlled
Hamiltonian systems with one degree of underactuation. A general design
procedure for IDA-PBC is given and illustrated with examples. The duality of
the new IDA-PBC method to the method of controlled Lagrangians is discussed.
This paper renders the IDA-PBC method as powerful as the controlled Lagrangian

aspect of these reports is that the double-gated devices consistently show much
higher mobility when measured using the weakly-coupled back gate (typically 300
nm of SiO2) than using the strongly-coupled top gate. While this difference
might be attributed to a different quality of the top and bottom surfaces, the
large discrepancy motivates close examination of the measurement techniques to
rule out spurious effects. Notably, it has been shown that the mobility may be
greatly overestimated in this geometry[10, 11]. There is good evidence that
this is the case here[4-9]; below we discuss Radisavljevic, et al.[4] as an

maximizing the similarity correlation. The motivation for using ""similarity""
originates in spectral clustering theory (see e.g. Ng et al 2001, Advances in
Neural Information Processing Systems 14: 849-856). We show that a particular
form of similarity correlation is asymptotically equivalent to distance
correlation for large values of the scale parameter. Furthermore, we extend
similarity correlation to coherence between complex valued vectors, including
its partitioning into real and imaginary contributions. Several toy examples
are used for comparing distance and similarity correlations. For instance,
points on a noiseless straight line give distance and similarity correlation
values equal to 1; but points on a noiseless circle produces near zero distance
correlation (dCorr=0.02) while the similarity correlation is distinctly non
zero (sCorr=0.36). In distinction to the distance approach, similarity gives
more importance to small distances, which emphasizes the local properties of
functional relations. This paper represents a preliminary empirical study,
showing that the novel similarity association has some distinct practical
advantages over distance based association.For the sake of reproducible

tissue is essential for studying morphogenesis and its physical constraints.
Experimental measurements of stress reported thus far have been invasive,
indirect, or local. One theoretical approach is force inference from cell
shapes and connectivity, which is non-invasive, can provide a space-time map of
stress and relies on prefactors. Here, to validate force- inference methods, we
performed a comparative study of them. Three force-inference methods, which
differ in their approach of treating indefiniteness in an inverse problem
between cell shapes and forces, were tested by using two artificial and two
experimental data sets. Our results using different datasets consistently
indicate that our Bayesian force inference, by which cell-junction tensions and
cell pressures are simultaneously estimated, performs best in terms of accuracy
and robustness. Moreover, by measuring the stress anisotropy and relaxation, we
cross-validated the force inference and the global annular ablation of tissue,
each of which relies on different prefactors. A practical choice of
force-inference methods in distinct systems of interest is discussed.

human population in developed countries. In the absence of strong purifying
selection, spontaneous and frequently deleterious mutations tend to accumulate
in the human genome and gradually increase the genetic load; that is, the
frequency of potentially lethal genes in the gene pool. Gradual increase in
incidence of many hereditary disorders suggests deleterious impact of the
genetic load on human well being. Many complex diseases such as type 1 and 2
diabetes, autism, bipolar disorder, allergies, Alzheimer disease, and some
cancers show significantly higher concordance in monozygotic (MZ) twins than in
dizygotic twins (DZ) or parent-child pairs, suggesting their etiology is
strongly influenced by genetics. Preventing these diseases based on genetic
data alone is frequently impossible. We hypothesize that the incidence of
complex diseases could be significantly reduced in the future through a
strategy based on time-separated twinning. This strategy involves the
collection and fertilization of human oocytes followed by several rounds of
artificial twinning. If preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) reports no
aneuploidy or known Mendelian disorders, one of the MZ siblings would be
implanted and the remaining embryos cryoconserved. Once the health of the adult
MZ sibling(s) is established, subsequent parenthood with the cryoconserved
twins could substantially lower the incidence of hereditary disorders with
Mendelian or complex etiology. The proposed method of artificial twinning has
the potential to alleviate suffering and reduce the negative social impact
induced by dysgenic effects associated with known and unknown genetic factors.
Time-separated twinning has the capacity to prevent further accumulation of the
genetic load and to provide source of isogenic embryonic stem cells for future
regenerative therapies.

of nodes that ever needs to be contacted during the repair of a failed node.
Having small repair locality is desirable, since it is proportional to the
number of disk accesses during repair. However, recent publications show that
small repair locality comes with a penalty in terms of code distance or storage
overhead if exact repair is required.
  Here, we first review some of the main results on storage codes under various
repair regimes and discuss the recent work on possible
(information-theoretical) trade-offs between repair locality and other code
parameters like storage overhead and code distance, under the exact repair
regime.
  Then we present some new information theoretical lower bounds on the storage
overhead as a function of the repair locality, valid for all common coding and
repair models. In particular, we show that if each of the $n$ nodes in a
distributed storage system has storage capacity $\ga$ and if, at any time, a
failed node can be {\em functionally} repaired by contacting {\em some} set of
$r$ nodes (which may depend on the actual state of the system) and downloading
an amount $\gb$ of data from each, then in the extreme cases where $\ga=\gb$ or
$\ga = r\gb$, the maximal coding rate is at most $r/(r+1)$ or 1/2, respectively

inelastic Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per colliding
nucleon pair with ALICE. The centrality is a key parameter in the study of the
properties of QCD matter at extreme temperature and energy density, because it
is directly related to the initial overlap region of the colliding nuclei.
Geometrical properties of the collision, such as the number of participating
nucleons and number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, are deduced from a
Glauber model with a sharp impact parameter selection, and shown to be
consistent with those extracted from the data. The centrality determination
provides a tool to compare ALICE measurements with those of other experiments
and with theoretical calculations.

the Universe under a large range of conditions, including subsonic turbulence
at low Mach numbers, highly supersonic turbulence at high Mach numbers and a
large range of magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm, i.e. the ratio of kinetic viscosity
to magnetic resistivity. Low Mach numbers may in particular lead to the
well-known, incompressible Kolmogorov turbulence, while for high Mach numbers,
we are in the highly compressible regime, thus close to Burgers turbulence. In
this study, we explore whether in this large range of conditions, a universal
behavior can be expected. Our starting point are previous investigations in the
kinematic regime. Here, analytic studies based on the Kazantsev model have
shown that the behavior of the dynamo depends significantly on Pm and the type
of turbulence, and numerical simulations indicate a strong dependence of the
growth rate on the Mach number of the flow. Once the magnetic field saturates
on the current amplification scale, backreactions occur and the growth is
shifted to the next-larger scale. We employ a Fokker-Planck model to calculate
the magnetic field amplification during the non-linear regime, and find a
resulting power-law growth that depends on the type of turbulence invoked. For
Kolmogorov turbulence, we confirm previous results suggesting a linear growth
of magnetic energy. For more general turbulent spectra, where the turbulent
velocity v_t scales with the characteristic length scale as u_\ell\propto
\ell^{\vartheta}, we find that the magnetic energy grows as
(t/T_{ed})^{2\vartheta/(1-\vartheta)}, with t the time-coordinate and T_{ed}
the eddy-turnover time on the forcing scale of turbulence. For Burgers
turbulence, \vartheta=1/2, a quadratic rather than linear growth may thus be
expected, and a larger timescale until saturation is reached.

decidability of the satisfiability problem for quantifier-free formulas.
  A skiplist is an imperative software data structure that implements sets by
maintaining several levels of ordered singly-linked lists in memory, where each
level is a sublist of its lower levels. Skiplists are widely used in practice
because they offer a performance comparable to balanced binary trees, and can
be implemented more efficiently. To achieve this performance, most
implementations dynamically increment the height (the number of levels).
Skiplists are difficult to reason about because of the dynamic size (number of
nodes) and the sharing between the different layers. Furthermore, reasoning
about dynamic height adds the challenge of dealing with arbitrary many levels.
  The first contribution of this paper is the theory TSL that allows to express
the heap memory layout of a skiplist of arbitrary height. The second
contribution is a decision procedure for the satisfiability prob- lem of
quantifier-free TSL formulas. The last contribution is to illustrate the formal
verification of a practical skiplist implementation using this decision
procedure.

complication in amplitudes for spacetimes regions constructed from path
integrals. This is the fact that the concrete implementation of the
restrictions on paths over an interval of time corresponds, in an operator
language, to sharp monitoring at every moment of time in the given time
interval. Such processes suffer from the quantum Zeno effect -- the continual
monitoring of a quantum system in a Hilbert subspace prevents its state from
leaving that subspace. As a consequence, path integral amplitudes defined in
this seemingly obvious way have physically and intuitively unreasonable
properties and in particular, no sensible classical limit. In this paper we
describe this frequently-occurring but little-appreciated phenomenon in some
detail, showing clearly the connection with the quantum Zeno effect. We then
show that it may be avoided by implementing the restriction on paths in the
path integral in a ""softer"" way. The resulting amplitudes then involve a new
coarse graining parameter, which may be taken to be a timescale $\eps$,
describing the softening of the restrictions on the paths. We argue that the
complications arising from the Zeno effect are then negligible as long as $\eps
>> 1/ E$, where $E$ is the energy scale of the incoming state. Our criticisms
of path integral constructions largely apply to approaches to quantum theory
such as the decoherent histories approach or quantum measure theory, which do
not specifically involve measurements. We address some criticisms of our
approach by Sokolovksi, concerning the relevance of our results to
measurement-based models.

$D_f$ of a single $d$-dimensional Brownian trajectory ${\bf B}_{t}$. We pursue
here the optimisation further by considering a family of weight functions of
the form $\omega(t) = (t_0 + t)^{-\alpha}$, where $t_0$ is a time lag and
$\alpha$ is an arbitrary real number, and seeking such values of $\alpha$ for
which the estimators most efficiently filter out the fluctuations. We calculate
$P(u_{\alpha})$ exactly for arbitrary $\alpha$ and arbitrary spatial dimension
$d$, and show that only for $\alpha = 2$ the distribution $P(u_{\alpha})$
converges, as $\epsilon = t_0/T \to 0$, to the Dirac delta-function centered at
the ensemble average value of the estimator. This allows us to conclude that
only the estimators with $\alpha = 2$ possess an ergodic property, so that the
ensemble averaged diffusion coefficient can be obtained with any necessary
precision from a single trajectory data, but at the expense of a progressively
higher experimental resolution. For any $\alpha \neq 2$ the distribution
attains, as $\epsilon \to 0$, a certain limiting form with a finite variance,
which signifies that such estimators are not ergodic.

Landau-Khalatnikov equation for shear stress, and the relaxation equation for

the conjugate field is reduced to the stress, and the temperature is the
control parameter. Within the adiabatic approximation, the steady-state values
of these quantities are found. Taking into account the sample shear modulus vs

linearly increases with the growth of the effective value of the sample shear
modulus and decreases with the growth of its typical value.

hole-light hole (hh-lh) mixing and all the spin-orbit terms arising from
zinc-blende bulk inversion asymmetry (BIA) are considered on equal footing in a

contributions to the hole spin relaxation in self-assembled QDs, but BIA
becomes dominant in gated QDs. The dependence of the hole spin relaxation on
the QD geometry and spin splitting energy is drastically different from that of
electrons, with a non-monotonic behavior which results from the interplay
between SOI terms. Our results reconcile contradictory predictions of previous
theoretical works and are consistent with experiments.

examining the wings of the CO(2-1) line as we moved away from the source
position. An integrated map of the wing emission between 3 kms$^{-1}$ and 5
kms$^{-1}$ reveals a blue-shifted lobe at a position of $\sim$ 20 \arcsec\ from
the FU Tau system and at a position angle of $\sim$ 20$^{\circ}$. The beam size
of the observations is $11\arcsec$\ hence it is not possible to distinguish
between the two components of the FU Tau binary. However as optical forbidden
emission, a strong tracer of the shocks caused by outflow activity, has been
detected in the spectrum of FU Tau A we assume this component to be the driving
source of the molecular outflow. We estimate the mass and mass outflow rate of
the outflow at 4 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ \Msun\ and 6 $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ \Msun/yr

outflows. FU Tau A is now the third BD found to be associated with molecular

study a certain class of idempotent elements E in the multiplier algebra of the

include the existence of non-degenerate anti-homomorphisms from B to M(C) and
from C to M(B), the multiplier algebras of C and B respectively. They are
called the antipodal maps. There also exist what we call distinguished linear
functionals. They are unique and faithful in the regular case. The notion is
more restrictive than what is generally considered in the case of
(finite-dimensional) algebras with identity. The separability idempotents we
consider in this paper are of a Frobenius type. It seems to be quite natural to
consider this type of separability idempotents in the case of non-degenerate
algebras possibly without an identity. One example is coming from a discrete
quantum group A. Here we take B=C=A and E is the image under the coproduct of
h, where h is the normalized cointegral. The antipodal maps coincide with the
original antipode and the distinguished linear functionals are the integrals.
Another example is obtained from a weak multiplier Hopf algebra A. Now B and C
are the images of the source and target maps. For E we take the canonical
idempotent. Again the antipodal maps come from the antipode of the weak
multiplier Hopf algebra. These two examples have motivated the study of
separability idempotents as used in this paper. We use the separability
idempotent to study modules over the base algebras B and C. In the regular

observed is produced by cosmic ray electrons with a spectrum similar to
Galactic cosmic rays. We argue that the cosmic ray electrons steepen near 1 TeV
from $E^{-3}$ to about $E^{-4.2}$, and are partially secondaries derived from
the knee-feature of normal cosmic rays. We speculate that the observed feature
at $\sim 130$ GeV could essentially be due to inverse Compton emission off a
pair-production peak on top of a turn-off in the $\gamma$ ray spectrum at $\sim
130$ GeV. It suggests that the knee of normal cosmic rays is the same
everywhere in the Galaxy. A consequence could be that all supernovae
contributing give the same cosmic ray spectrum, with the knee feature given by
common stellar properties; in fact, this is consistent with the supernova
theory proposed by Bisnovatyi-Kogan (1970), a magneto-rotational mechanism, if
massive stars converge to common properties in terms of rotation and magnetic
fields just before they explode.

weighted Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks. Numerical evidence is provided
that phases with slow, power-law dynamics emerge as the consequence of quenched
disorder and tree topologies studied previously with the Contact Process. I
compare simulation results with spectral analysis of the networks and show that
the quenched mean-field (QMF) approximation provides a reliable, relatively
fast method to explore activity clustering. This suggests that QMF can be used
for describing rare-region effects due to network inhomogeneities. Finite size
study of the QMF shows the expected disappearance of the epidemic threshold
$\lambda_c$ in the thermodynamic limit and an inverse participation ratio $\sim
0.25$, meaning localization in case of disassortative weight scheme. Contrary,
for the multiplicative weights and the unweighted trees this value vanishes in
the thermodynamic limit, suggesting only weak rare region effects in agreement
with the dynamical simulations. Strong corrections to the mean-field behavior
in case of disassortative weights explains the concave shape of the order
parameter $\rho(\lambda)$ at the transition point. Application of this method
to other models may reveal interesting rare-region effects, Griffiths Phases as
the consequence of quenched topological heterogeneities.

gapless, provides direct evidence of the topological transition.

of compressible and incompressible driving on the evolution of turbulent
spectra in a number of possible interstellar medium scenarios. We conclude that
the driving not only has an influence on the ratio of compressible to

this process in the special case where the fertility function is exponential so

on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators, where the time
reversal symmetry is preserved. It is shown that the images of the local
density of states (LDOS) around the single impurity have the dip-hump
structures with six-fold symmetry at different bias voltages. The peaks are
produced by quasiparticle interference while the local minima at the
backscattering wave vectors are due to the absence of backscatterings. With
increasing the bias voltage, the peaks and dips move forward to the location of
the impurity. These dips at the backscattering wave vectors in the LDOS spectra
can be regarded as a signature of the time reversal symmetry in the topological
surface states, which could be observed by scanning tunneling microscopy.

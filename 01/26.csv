  Haiti",,,,,"q-bio.PE stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a simple model with two infective classes in order to model the
cholera epidemic in Haiti. We include the impact of environmental events
(rainfall, temperature and tidal range) on the epidemic in the Artibonite and
Ouest regions by introducing terms in the transmission rate that vary with
environmental conditions. We fit the model on weekly data from the beginning of
the epidemic until December 2013, including the vaccination programs that were
recently undertaken in the Ouest and Artibonite regions. We then modified these
projections excluding vaccination to assess the programs' effectiveness. Using
real-time daily rainfall, we found lag times between precipitation events and
new cases that range from 3.4 to 8.4 weeks in Artibonite and 5.1 to 7.4 in
Ouest. In addition, it appears that, in the Ouest region, tidal influences play
a significant role in the dynamics of the disease. Intervention efforts of all
types have reduced case numbers in both regions; however, persistent outbreaks
continue. In Ouest, where the population at risk seems particularly besieged
and the overall population is larger, vaccination efforts seem to be taking
hold more slowly than in Artibonite, where a smaller core population was
vaccinated. The models including the vaccination programs predicted that a year
and six months later, the mean number of cases in Artibonite would be reduced
by about two thousand cases, and in Ouest by twenty four hundred cases below
that predicted by the models without vaccination. We also found that
vaccination is best when done in the early spring, and as early as possible in
the epidemic. Comparing vaccination between the first spring and the second,
there is a drop of about 40% in the case reduction due to the vaccine and about
10% per year after that.

philosophy of Taoism where two different views can co-exist in harmony. This is
not enough to explain Einstein's discovery of the mass-energy relation. The
energy-momentum relations for slow and ultra-fast particles take different
forms. Einstein was able to synthesize these two formulas to create his
energy-mass relation. Indeed, this is what Hegelianism is about in physics.

splice sites. Here we analyse the CG-content ratio of pre-miRNAs and mirtrons
and compare them with their genomic neighbourhood in an attempt to establish
key properties which are easy to evaluate and to understand their biogenesis.
We propose a simple log-ratio of the CG-content comparing the precursor
sequence and is flanking region. We discovered that Caenorhabditis elegans and
Drosophila melanogaster mirtrons, so far without exception, have smaller
CG-content than their genomic neighbourhood. This is markedly different from
usual pre-miRNAs which mostly have larger CG-content when compared to their
genomic neighbourhood. We also analysed some mammalian and primate mirtrons
which, in contrast the invertebrate mirtrons, have higher CG-content ratio.

an efficient mechanism for the transport of energy toward the medium, which is
akin to wave turbulence with a scaling spectrum $\sim 1/\sqrt{\omega}$. We

timescale of Mars to be 1.8 $^{+0.9}_{-1.0}$ Myr from the W isotopes of martian
meteorites. This timescale was derived assuming perfect metal-silicate
equilibration between the impactor and the target's mantle. However, in the
case of a small impactor most likely only a fraction of the target's mantle is
involved in the equilibration, while only a small part of the impactor's core
equilibrates in the case of a giant impact. We examined the effects of
imperfect equilibration using results of high-resolution $N$-body simulations
for the oligarchic growth stage. These effects were found to be small as long
as a planetary embryo has a deep liquid magma ocean during its accretion. The
effect due to partial involvement of the target's mantle in equilibration is
small due to the low metal-silicate partition coefficient for W suggested from
the low Hf/W ratio of the martian mantle. The effect due to partial involvement
of the impactor's core is also small because a large fraction of the embryo
mass is delivered from small planetesimals, which are likely to fully
equilibrate in the deep magma ocean on the embryo. The accretion timescale of
Mars estimated by the Hf-W chronology is shorter than that expected for the
minimum mass solar nebula model as long as more than 10% of each impactor's
core re-equilibrates with the martian mantle and the final stages of accretion
are prolonged. This probably indicates that accretion of Mars proceeded rapidly
due to solid and gas surface densities significantly larger than those for the
minimum mass solar nebula or due to accretion of small fragments or pebbles.

increasing transparency by making the DebtRank of individual nodes (banks)

interbank borrowing from systemically risky nodes, the systemic risk in the

effective regulation mechanism, that does not reduce the efficiency of the
financial network, but fosters a more homogeneous distribution of risk within
the system in a self-organized critical way. We show that the reduction of

technique yields a high-density, regular grid of wind velocity vectors that is
advantageous over a limited number of scattered wind vectors that result from
manual cloud tracking. The high-velocity collar of the GRS is clearly seen from
our velocity vector map, and highest wind velocities are measured to be around
170 m/s. The high resolution of the mosaics have also enabled us to map
turbulent eddies inside the chaotic central region of the GRS, similar to those
mapped by Sada et al. (1996) and Vasavada et al. (1998). Using the wind
velocity measurements, we computed particle trajectories around the GRS as well
as maps of relative and absolute vorticities. We have discovered a narrow ring
of cyclonic vorticity that surrounds the main anti-cyclonic high-velocity
collar. This narrow ring appears to correspond to a ring surrounding the GRS
that is bright in 5-microns (Terrile and Beebe 1979). It appears that this
cyclonic ring is not a transient feature of the GRS, as we have discovered it
in a re-analysis of Galileo data taken in 1996 first analyzed by Vasavada et
al. (1998). We also calculate how absolute vorticity changes as a function of
latitude along a trajectory around the GRS and compare these measurements to
similar ones performed by Dowling and Ingersoll (1988) using Voyager data. We
show no dramatic evolution in the structure of the GRS since the Voyager era

velocity in the main velocity collar, and an overall decrease in the length of

$h(X|Y,\hat{H})$ by the entropy of a Gaussian random variable with variance
equal to the linear minimum mean-square error in estimating $X$ from
$(Y,\hat{H})$. We demonstrate that, using a rate-splitting approach, this lower
bound can be sharpened: by expressing the Gaussian input $X$ as the sum of two
independent Gaussian variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ and by applying M\'edard's lower
bound first to bound the mutual information between $X_1$ and $Y$ while
treating $X_2$ as noise, and by applying it a second time to the mutual
information between $X_2$ and $Y$ while assuming $X_1$ to be known, we obtain a
capacity lower bound that is strictly larger than M\'edard's lower bound. We
then generalize this approach to an arbitrary number $L$ of layers, where $X$
is expressed as the sum of $L$ independent Gaussian random variables of
respective variances $P_{\ell}$, $\ell = 1,\dotsc,L$ summing up to $P$. Among
all such rate-splitting bounds, we determine the supremum over power
allocations $P_\ell$ and total number of layers $L$. This supremum is achieved
for $L\to\infty$ and gives rise to an analytically expressible capacity lower
bound. For Gaussian fading, this novel bound is shown to converge to the
Gaussian-input mutual information as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) grows,
provided that the variance of the channel estimation error $H-\hat{H}$ tends to
zero as the SNR tends to infinity.

boson where the Higgs decays to $W$ boson pairs, $VH\to VWW \to \ell\nu jjjj$
production (where $V = W$ or $Z$). We observe good agreement between data and
expected background. We test our method by measuring $WZ$ and $ZZ$ production
with $Z\to b\bar{b}$ and find production rates consistent with the standard
model prediction. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, we set a 95%\ C.L. upper
limit on the production of a standard model Higgs boson of
\obslimA$\times\sigma_{\rm SM}$, where $\sigma_{\rm SM}$ is the standard model
Higgs boson production cross section, while the expected limit is

Saturn's thermal emission. We have also constructed a zonal wind profile from
VIMS feature tracking observation sequences using an automated cloud feature
tracker. Comparison with previously constructed profiles from Voyager and
Cassini imaging data reveals broad similarities, suggesting minimal vertical
shear of the zonal wind. However, areas of apparent wind shear are present in
the VIMS zonal wind profile at jet stream cores. In particular, our analysis
shows that the equatorial jet reaches speeds exceeding 450 m/s, similar to
speeds obtained during the Voyager era. This suggests that recent inferences of
relatively slower jet speeds of ~275-375 m/s are confined to the upper
troposphere and that the deep (>1 bar) jet has not experienced a significant
slowdown. Our measurements of the numerous dark, spotted features seen in the
VIMS mosaics reveals that most of these features have diameters less than 1000
km and reside in confined zonal bands between jet stream cores. We propose that
these spot features are vortices and that VIMS and ISS are sensing the same
vortices at two different pressure levels. The local structure at the zonal jet
streams remains complex, as VIMS may be sensing cloud features that are deeper

only one Oval BA (Cassini), and finally to Oval BA's current reddened state

evolved along with their appearance. The northern periphery of Oval BA
increased in speed by 20 m/s from Cassini to New Horizons, ending up at a speed
nearly identical to that of the northern periphery of Oval DE during Galileo.
However, the peak speeds along the southern rim of the newly formed Oval BA
were consistently faster than the corresponding speeds in Oval DE, and they
increased still further between Cassini and New Horizons, ending up at ~140 to
150 m/s. The modest strengthening of the winds in Oval BA, the appearance of
red aerosols, and the appearance of a turbulent, cyclonic feature to Oval BA's
northwest create a strong resemblance with the Great Red Spot from both a
dynamical and morphological perspective. In addition to the White Ovals, we
also measure the winds within two compact cyclonic regions, one in the Galileo

features appear turbulent and filamentary, but our wind field reveals that the
flow manifests as a coherent high-speed collar surrounding relatively quiescent

Active features, such as dust devils, appear in motion when observed by this

tangential winds that approach 20-30 m/s in some cases. These winds are
sufficient to induce a ~1% decrease in atmospheric pressure within the dust
devil core relative to ambient, facilitating dust lifting by reducing the
threshold wind speed for particle elevation. Finally, radial velocity profiles
constructed from our automated measurements test the Rankine vortex model for
dust devil structure. Our profiles successfully reveal the solid body rotation
component in the interior, but fail to conclusively illuminate the profile in
the outer regions of the vortex. One profile provides evidence for a velocity
decrease as a function of r^-1/2, instead of r^-1, suggestive of surface
friction effects. However, other profiles do not support this observation, or

spectra of two-dimensional turbulence, with power-law slopes near -5/3 and -3
at low and high wavenumbers, respectively. The slopes of the kinetic energy
power spectrum are also near -5/3 at low wavenumbers. At high wavenumbers,
however, the spectral slopes are relatively flatter than the theoretical

slopes from full 2D velocity maps rather than 1D zonal mean velocity profiles,

wavenumbers, the 1D zonal and full 2D kinetic energy spectra are practically
indistinguishable. Furthermore, the difference between the image and kinetic

Film magnetoresistances on the superconducting side of the SIT oscillate with a

The oscillations disappear close to the SIT critical point to leave a

candidates as genuine high-redshift candidates, and extends our samples to
higher redshift and fainter limits (H_160~29.8 mag). We perform one of the
first estimates of the z~9 UV LF and improve our previous constraints at z~10.
Extrapolating the lower redshift UV LF evolution should have revealed 17 z~9

inferred star-formation rate density (SFRD) in galaxies above 0.7 M_sun/yr
decreases by 0.6+-0.2 dex from z~8 to z~9, in good agreement with previous

current measurements, we find a best estimate of a factor 10x decrease in the
SFRD from z~8 to z~10, following (1+z)^(-11.4+-3.1). Our measurements thus
confirm our previous finding of an accelerated evolution beyond z~8, and

ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is being probed by neutrino
observations. Very stringent bounds can be obtained from the cosmic ray
(proton)--neutrino connection, assuming that the UHECRs escape as neutrons. In
this study, we identify three different regimes as a function of the fireball
parameters: the standard ""one neutrino per cosmic ray"" case, the optically
thick (to neutron escape) case, and the case where leakage of protons from the
boundaries of the shells (direct escape) dominates. In the optically thick
regime, photomeson production is very efficient, and more neutrinos will be
emitted per cosmic ray than in the standard case, whereas in the direct
escape-dominated regime, more cosmic rays than neutrinos will be emitted. We
demonstrate that, for efficient proton acceleration, which is required to
describe the observed UHECR spectrum, the standard case only applies to a very

observed examples that conclusions on the cosmic ray--neutrino connection will

production efficiency currently used by the IceCube collaboration

point out that the direct escape component leads to a spectral break in the
cosmic ray spectrum emitted from a single source. The resulting ""two-component

observed UHECR spectrum than the dip model.

towards the stars rho Oph A, B, C and DE using the University College London

of some of the DIBs are found to differ by about 5-9 % between the close binary
stars rho Oph A and B, which are separated by a projected distance on the sky
of only ~344 AU. This is the first star-system in which such small-scale DIB
strength variations have been reported. The observed variations are attributed
to differences between a combination of carrier abundance and the physical
conditions present along each sightline. The sightline towards rho Oph C
contains relatively dense, molecule-rich material and has the strongest
\lambda\lambda 5850 and 4726 DIBs. The gas towards DE is more diffuse and is
found to exhibit weak C_2 (blue) DIBs and strong yellow/red DIBs. The
differences in diffuse band strengths between lines of sight are, in some

with the Wheeler--DeWitt equation, time disappears, and a frozen formalism that
gives a static wavefunction on the space of possible shapes of the system is
obtained. However, if one follows the Dirac procedure and quantizes by imposing
constraints, the potential that ensures scale invariance gives rise to a
conformal anomaly, and the scale invariance is broken. A behaviour closely
analogous to renormalization-group (RG) flow results. The wavefunction acquires
a dependence on the scale parameter of the RG flow. We interpret this as time
evolution and obtain a novel solution of the problem of time in quantum
gravity. We apply the general procedure to the three-body problem, showing how
to fix a natural initial value condition, introducing the notion of complexity.
We recover a time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation with a repulsive
cosmological force in the `late-time' physics and we analyse the role of the

being used as a thruster and then eliminate the thrust by arranging equal brass
masses on either end, so that essentially the capacitor stack is trying to push
in both directions at once. This arrangement in theory would only allow for a
small oscillation but no net thrust. We find the thrust does indeed disappear

thermal properties of graphene stem from its 2D nature, forming a rich
playground for new discoveries of heat flow physics and potentially leading to

model on a cubic lattice have recently attracted considerable attention due to
their possible experimental realization via cold atoms in an optical lattice.
Because analytical and numerical results are limited away from half-filling, we
study the ground state of the doped system from weak to intermediate
interaction strengths within the generalized Hartree-Fock approximation. The
exact solution to the self-consistent-field equations in the thermodynamic
limit is obtained and the ground state is shown to exhibit antiferromagnetic
order and incommensurate spin-density waves (SDW). At low interaction
strengths, the SDW has unidirectional character with a leading wave-vector
along the $<100>$-direction, and the system is metallic. As the interaction
increases, the system undergoes a simultaneous structural and
metal-to-insulator transition to a unidirectional SDW state along the
$<111>$-direction, with a different wavelength. We systematically determine the
real- and momentum-space properties of these states. The crossover from 3D to
two-dimensions (2D) is then studied by varying the inter-plane hopping
amplitude, which can be experimentally realized by tuning the distance between
a stack of square-lattice layers. Detailed comparisons are made between the
exact numerical results and predictions from the pairing model, a variational
{\em ansatz} based on the pairing of spins in the vicinity of the Fermi
surface. Most of the numerical results can be understood quantitatively from
the ansatz, which provides a simple picture for the nature of the SDW states.

of GALEX, we are able probe systems with lower activity levels and at larger

samples of stars with close-in planets (a < 0.1 AU) to those with far-out
planets (a > 0.5 AU) and looked for correlations of excess activity with other
system parameters. This statistical investigation found no clear correlations
with a, M_p, nor M_p/a, in contrast to some X-ray and Ca II studies. However,
there is tentative evidence (at a level of 1.8-\sigma) that stars with

planets, in agreement with several published X-ray and Ca II results. The case
is strengthened to a level of significance of 2.3-\sigma\ when transit-detected

comparable stars, while the transit-selected sample is similarly active. Given
the factor of 2-3 scatter in fractional FUV luminosity for a given stellar
effective temperature, it is necessary to conduct a time-resolved study of the

probed by a coherent laser field. We focus on an ensemble of qubits
dispersively coupled to a traveling wave light field. The first research topic
explores the quantum measurement statistics of a quasi-monochromatic laser
probe. We identify the shortest timescale that successive measurements
approximately commute. Our model predicts that for a probe in the near
infrared, noncommuting measurement effects are apparent for subpicosecond
times.
  The second dissertation topic attempts to find an approximation to a
conditional master equation, which maps identical product states to identical
product states. Through a technique known as projection filtering, we find such
a equation for an ensemble of qubits experiencing a diffusive measurement of a
collective angular momentum projection, and global rotations. We then test the
quality of the approximation through numerical simulations. In the presence of
strong randomized rotations, the approximation reproduces the exact expectation
values to within 95%.
  The final topic applies the projection filter to the problem of state
reconstruction. We find an initial state estimate based on a single continuous
measurement of an identically prepared atomic ensemble. Given the ability to
make a continuous collective measurement and simultaneously applying time
varying controls, it is possible to find an accurate estimate given based upon
a single measurement realization. Here we explore the fundamental limits of
this protocol by studying an idealized model for pure qubits, which is limited
only by measurement backaction. Using the exact dynamics to produce simulated
measurements, we then numerically search for a maximum likelihood estimate
based on the approximate expression. Our estimation technique nearly achieves

the number of alignment solutions is the scaled average of the determinant of a

while the value of this determinant at an arbitrary point can be used to check
the feasibility of the IA problem, its average (properly scaled) gives the

primary and K-1 secondary/cognitive transmitters with a cumulative message
sharing structure, i.e cognitive transmitter $i\in [2:K]$ knows non-causally
all messages of the users with index less than i. We propose a computable outer
bound valid for any memoryless channel. We first evaluate the sum-rate outer
bound for the high- SNR linear deterministic approximation of the Gaussian
noise channel. This is shown to be capacity for the 3-user channel with
arbitrary channel gains and the sum-capacity for the symmetric K-user channel.
Interestingly. for the K user channel having only the K th cognitive know all
the other messages is sufficient to achieve capacity i.e cognition at
transmitter 2 to K-1 is not needed. Next the sum capacity of the symmetric
Gaussian noise channel is characterized to within a constant additive and
multiplicative gap. The proposed achievable scheme for the additive gap is
based on Dirty paper coding and can be thought of as a MIMO-broadcast scheme
where only one encoding order is possible due to the message sharing structure.
As opposed to other multiuser interference channel models, a single scheme
suffices for both the weak and strong interference regimes. With this scheme
the generalized degrees of freedom (gDOF) is shown to be a function of K, in
contrast to the non cognitive case and the broadcast channel case.
Interestingly, it is show that as the number of users grows to infinity the
gDoF of the K-user cognitive interference channel with cumulative message
sharing tends to the gDoF of a broadcast channel with a K-antenna transmitter
and K single-antenna receivers. The analytical additive additive and
multiplicative gaps are a function of the number of users. Numerical
evaluations of inner and outer bounds show that the actual gap is less than the
analytical one.

graphical languages, we then revisit probability theory from a categorical
perspective and introduce Bayesian networks, an existing structure for
describing causal relationships. Motivated by these, we propose a new algebraic
structure, which we term a causal theory. These take the form of a symmetric
monoidal category, with the objects representing variables and morphisms ways
of deducing information about one variable from another. A major advantage of
reasoning with these structures is that the resulting graphical representations
of morphisms match well with intuitions for flows of information between these
variables. These categories can then be modelled in other categories, providing
concrete interpretations for the variables and morphisms. In particular, we
shall see that models in the category of measurable spaces and stochastic maps
provide a slight generalisation of Bayesian networks, and naturally form a
category themselves. We conclude with a discussion of this category,
classifying the morphisms and discussing some basic universal constructions.

jets where the source has a time-dependent injection velocity and mass-loss
rate. The variation of the injection velocity produces a two-shock wave
structure, the working surface, that moves along the jet. This new formalism
takes into account the fact that momentum conservation is not valid for
relativistic flows where the relativistic mass lost by radiation must be taken
into account, in contrast to the classic regime. We find analytic solutions for
the working surface velocity and radiated energy for the particular case of a
step function variability of the injection parameters. We model two cases: a
pulse of fast material and a pulse of slow material (with respect to the mean
flow). Applying these models to gamma ray burst light curves, one can determine
the ratio of the Lorentz factors gamma_2 / gamma_1 and the ratio of the
mass-loss rates dot{m_2} / dot{m_1} of the upstream and downstream flows. As an
example, we apply this model to the sources GRB 080413B and GRB 070318 and find
the values of these ratios. Assuming a Lorentz factor gamma_1=100, we further
estimate jet mass-loss rates between dot{m_1} ~ 10^{-5}-1 Msun.yr^{-1}. We also
calculate the fraction of the injected mass lost by radiation. For GRB 070318
this fraction is ~7%. In contrast, for GRB 080413B this fraction is larger than
50%; in this case radiation losses clearly affect the dynamics of the internal
shocks.

cosmology (LQC), {\em directly at the quantum level}. Such a firmer
understanding would increase confidence in the reduced theory as a tool for
formulating predictions of the full theory, as well as permitting lessons from
the reduced theory to guide further development in the full theory. The present
paper constructs an embedding of the usual state space of LQC into that of
standard LQG, that is, LQG based on \textit{piecewise analytic paths}. The
embedding is well-defined even prior to solving the diffeomorphism constraint,
at no point is a graph fixed, and at no point is the piecewise linear category
used. This motivates for the first time a definition of operators in LQC
corresponding to holonomies along non-piecewise-linear paths, without changing
the usual kinematics of LQC in any way. The new embedding intertwines all
operators corresponding to such holonomies, and all elements in its image
satisfy an operator equation which classically implies homogeneity and
isotropy. The construction is made possible by a recent result proven by
Fleischhack.

negation in logic, seen as both a value and an operator, can generate the
fusion algebra for a Majorana fermion, a particle that is its own anti-particle
and interacts with itself either to annihilate itself or to produce itself. We
call negation in this mode the mark, as it operates on itself to change from
marked to unmarked states. The mark viewed recursively as a simplest discrete
dynamical system naturally generates the fermion algebra, the quaternions and
the braid group representations related to Majorana fermions. The paper begins
with these fundmentals. They provide a conceptual key to many of the models
that appear later in the paper. In particular, the Fibonacci model for
topological quantum computing is seen to be based on the fusion rules for a
Majorana fermion and these in turn are the interaction rules for the mark seen
as a logical particle. It requires a shift in viewpoint to see that the
operator of negation can also be seen as a logical value. The quaternions
emerge naturally from the reentering mark. All these models have their roots in
unitary representations of the Artin braid group to the quaternions.

direction in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in low-Prandtl-number fluids has been
studied using a low dimensional model. The model shows the onset of convection
(primary instability) in the form of two dimensional stationary rolls in the
absence of magnetic field, when the Rayleigh number $R$ is raised above a
critical value $R_c$. The flow becomes three dimensional at slightly higher
values of Rayleigh number via wavy instability. These wavy rolls become chaotic
for slightly higher values of $R$ in low-Prandtl-number ($P_r$) fluids. A
uniform magnetic field along horizontal plane strongly affects all kinds of
convective flows observed at higher values of $R$ in its absence. As the
magnetic field is raised above certain value, it orients the convective rolls
in its own direction. Although the horizontal magnetic field does not change
the threshold for the primary instability, it affects the threshold for
secondary (wavy) instability. It inhibits the onset of wavy instability. The
critical Rayleigh number $R_o (Q,P_r)$ at the onset of wavy instability, which
depends on Chandrasekhar's number $Q$ and $P_r$, increases monotonically with
$Q$ for a fixed value of $P_r$. The dimensionless number $R_o (Q, P_r)/(R_c Q
P_r)$ scales with $Q$ as $Q^{-1}$. A stronger magnetic field suppresses chaos
and makes the flow two dimensional with roll pattern aligned along its
direction.

instability of giant planets which causes a fast dynamical dispersion of a
transneptunian cometary disk. We study effects produced by these hypothetical
cometary projectiles on main-belt asteroids. In particular, we want to check
whether the observed collisional families provide a lower or an upper limit for
the cometary flux during the LHB.
  We present an updated list of observed asteroid families as identified in the
space of synthetic proper elements by the hierarchical clustering method,
colour data, albedo data and dynamical considerations and we estimate their
physical parameters. We selected 12 families which may be related to the LHB
according to their dynamical ages. We then used collisional models and N-body
orbital simulations to gain insight into the long-term dynamical evolution of
synthetic LHB families over 4 Gyr. We account for the mutual collisions, the
physical disruptions of comets, the Yarkovsky/YORP drift, chaotic diffusion, or
possible perturbations by the giant-planet migration.
  Assuming a ""standard"" size-frequency distribution of primordial comets, we
predict the number of families with parent-body sizes D_PB >= 200 km which
seems consistent with observations. However, more than 100 asteroid families
with D_PB >= 100 km should be created at the same time which are not observed.
This discrepancy can be nevertheless explained by the following processes: i)
asteroid families are efficiently destroyed by comminution (via collisional
cascade), ii) disruptions of comets below some critical perihelion distance (q
<~ 1.5 AU) are common.
  Given the freedom in the cometary-disruption law, we cannot provide stringent
limits on the cometary flux, but we can conclude that the observed distribution
of asteroid families does not contradict with a cometary LHB.

localization. Practically, if it does exist, owing to its simplicity
macroscopic equations can be mastered far more easily than sophisticated
microscopic theories of wave localization especially for experimentalists. The
purposes of the present paper are two-fold. On the one hand, it is devoted to a
review of substantial recent progress in this subject. We show that in random
open media the wave energy density obeys a highly unconventional macroscopic
diffusion equation at scales much larger than the elastic mean free path. The
diffusion coefficient is inhomogeneous in space; most strikingly, as a function
of the distance to the interface, it displays novel single parameter scaling
which captures the impact of rare high-transmission states that dominate
long-time transport of localized waves. We review aspects of this novel
macroscopic diffusive phenomenon. On the other hand, it is devoted to a review
of the supersymmetric field theory of light localization in open media. In

overcoming challenges in multiple areas: managing large-scale data
distribution, controlling co-placement and scheduling of data with compute

Although there exist multiple approaches to addressing each of these
challenges, an integrative approach is missing; furthermore, extending existing
functionality or enabling interoperable capabilities remains difficult at best.
We propose the concept of Pilot-Data to address the fundamental challenges of
co-placement and scheduling of data and compute in heterogeneous and
distributed environments with interoperability and extensibility as first-order
concerns. Pilot-Data is an extension of the Pilot-Job abstraction for
supporting the management of data in conjunction with compute tasks. Pilot-Data
separates logical data units from physical storage, thereby providing the basis
for efficient compute/data placement and scheduling. In this paper, we discuss
the design and implementation of the Pilot-Data prototype, demonstrate its use
by data-intensive applications on multiple production distributed
cyberinfrastructure and illustrate the advantages arising from flexible
execution modes enabled by Pilot-Data. Our experiments utilize an
implementation of Pilot-Data in conjunction with a scalable Pilot-Job (BigJob)
to establish the application performance that can be enabled by the use of
Pilot-Data. We demonstrate how the concept of Pilot-Data also provides the
basis upon which to build tools and support capabilities like affinity which in
turn can be used for advanced data-compute co-placement and scheduling.

comes from the analysis of the Lotka-Volterra's competition system with
mutation which simulates the demo-genetic dynamics of diverse virus in their
host : $$ \frac{dv_{i}(t)}{dt}=v_i\[r_i-\frac{1}{K}\Psi_i(v)\]+\sum_{j=1}^{N}
\mu_{ij}(v_j-v_i). $$ In a first part we analyse the case where the competition
terms $\Psi_i$ are independent of the virus type $i$. In this situation and
under some rather general assumptions on the functions $\Psi_i$, the
coefficients $r_i$ and the mutation matrix $\mu_{ij}$ we prove the existence of
a unique positive globally stable stationary solution i.e. the solution
attracts the trajectory initiated from any nonnegative initial datum. Moreover
the unique steady state $\bar v$ is strictly positive in the sense that $\bar
v_i>0$ for all $i$. These results are in sharp contrast with the behaviour of
Lotka-Volterra without mutation term where it is known that multiple non
negative stationary solutions exist and an exclusion principle occurs (i.e For
all $i\neq i_0, \bar v_{i}=0$ and $\bar v_{i_0}>0$). Then we explore a typical
example that has been proposed to explain some experimental data. For such
particular models we characterise the speed of convergence to the equilibrium.
In a second part, under some additional assumption, we prove the existence of a
positive steady state for the full system and we analyse the long term
dynamics. The proofs mainly rely on the construction of a relative entropy

Fluids 25, 023602 (2013)","10.1063/1.4790809",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The deformation of two-dimensional vortex patches in the vicinity of fluid
boundaries is investigated. The presence of a boundary causes an initially
circular patch of uniform vorticity to deform. Sufficiently far away from the
boundary, the deformed shape is well approximated by an ellipse. This leading
order elliptical deformation is investigated via the elliptic moment model of
Melander, Zabusky & Styczek [M. V. Melander, N. J. Zabusky & A. S. Styczek, J.
Fluid. Mech., 167, 95 (1986)]. When the boundary is straight, the centre of the
elliptic patch remains at a constant distance from the boundary, and the motion
is integrable. Furthermore, since the straining flow acting on the patch is
constant in time, the problem is that of an elliptic vortex patch in constant
strain, which was analysed by Kida [S. Kida, J. Phys. Soc. Japan, 50, 3517
(1981)]. For more complicated boundary shapes, such as a square corner, the
motion is no longer integrable. Instead, there is an adiabatic invariant for
the motion. This adiabatic invariant arises due to the separation in times
scales between the relatively rapid time scale associated with the rotation of
the patch and the slower time scale associated with the self-advection of the
patch along the boundary. The interaction of a vortex patch with a circular
island is also considered. Without a background flow, conservation of angular
impulse implies that the motion is again integrable. The addition of an
irrotational flow past the island can drive the patch towards the boundary,
leading to the possibility of large deformations and breakup.

between the different types of assets in the game. It depicts the
dependency-based relationships between the assets of a game. For example, a
player must construct an arsenal before he can build weapons. It is vital that
the dependency graph of a game is designed logically to ensure a logical
sequence of game play. However, a mere logical dependency graph is not
sufficient in sustaining the players' enduring interests in a game, which
brings the problem of game balancing into picture. The issue of game balancing
arises when the players do not feel the chances of winning the game over their
AI opponents who are more skillful in the game play. At the current state of
research, the architecture of dependency graph is monolithic for the players.
The sequence of asset possession is always foreseeable because there is only a
single dependency graph. Game balancing is impossible when the assets of AI
players are overwhelmingly outnumbering that of human players. This paper
proposes a parallel architecture of dependency graph for the AI players and
human players. Instead of having a single dependency graph, a parallel
architecture is proposed where the dependency graph of AI player is adjustable
with that of human player using a support dependency as a game balancing
mechanism. This paper exhibits that the parallel dependency graph helps to

about governmental or corporate misconduct. Despite these laws, whistleblowers
frequently risk reprisals and sites such as WikiLeaks emerged to provide a
level of anonymity to these individuals. However, as countries increase their
level of network surveillance and Internet protocol data retention, the mere
act of using anonymizing software such as Tor, or accessing a whistleblowing
website through an SSL channel might be incriminating enough to lead to
investigations and repercussions. As an alternative submission system we
propose an online advertising network called AdLeaks. AdLeaks leverages the
ubiquity of unsolicited online advertising to provide complete sender
unobservability when submitting disclosures. AdLeaks ads compute a random
function in a browser and submit the outcome to the AdLeaks infrastructure.
Such a whistleblower's browser replaces the output with encrypted information
so that the transmission is indistinguishable from that of a regular browser.
Its back-end design assures that AdLeaks must process only a fraction of the
resulting traffic in order to receive disclosures with high probability. We
describe the design of AdLeaks and evaluate its performance through analysis
and experimentation.

  Catastrophe in Protostellar Disk Formation?","29 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/774/1/82",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stars form in dense cores of molecular clouds that are observed to be
significantly magnetized. In the simplest case of a laminar (non-turbulent)
core with the magnetic field aligned with the rotation axis, both analytic
considerations and numerical simulations have shown that the formation of a
large, $10^2\au$-scale, rotationally supported protostellar disk is suppressed
by magnetic braking in the ideal MHD limit for a realistic level of core
magnetization. This theoretical difficulty in forming protostellar disks is
termed ""magnetic braking catastrophe"". A possible resolution to this problem,
proposed by \citeauthor{HennebelleCiardi2009} and \citeauthor{Joos+2012}, is
that misalignment between the magnetic field and rotation axis may weaken the
magnetic braking enough to enable disk formation. We evaluate this possibility
quantitatively through numerical simulations. We confirm the basic result of
\citeauthor{Joos+2012} that the misalignment is indeed conducive to disk
formation. In relatively weakly magnetized cores with dimensionless
mass-to-flux ratio $\gtrsim 5$, it enabled the formation of rotationally
supported disks that would otherwise be suppressed if the magnetic field and
rotation axis are aligned. For more strongly magnetized cores, disk formation
remains suppressed, however, even for the maximum tilt angle of $90\degree$. If
dense cores are as strongly magnetized as indicated by OH Zeeman observations
(with a mean dimensionless mass-to-flux ratio $\sim 2$), it would be difficult
for the misalignment alone to enable disk formation in the majority of them. We
conclude that, while beneficial to disk formation, especially for the
relatively weak field case, the misalignment does not completely solve the
problem of catastrophic magnetic braking in general.

ultra-narrowband continuous waveforms (CW) as an illumination source. Such a
system has many practical advantages, such as the use of relatively simple,
low-cost and low-power transmitters, and in some cases, using the transmitters
of opportunity, such as TV, radio stations. Additionally, ultra-narrowband CW
signals are suitable for motion estimation due to their ability to acquire high
resolution Doppler information. In this paper, we present a novel synthetic
aperture imaging method for moving targets using a bi-static SAR system
transmitting ultra-narrowband continuous waveforms. Our method exploits the
high Doppler resolution provided by ultra-narrowband CW signals to image both
the scene reflectivity and to determine the velocity of multiple moving
targets. Starting from the first principle, we develop a novel forward model
based on the temporal Doppler induced by the movement of antennas and moving
targets. We form the reflectivity image of the scene and estimate the motion
parameters using a filtered-backprojection technique combined with a contrast
optimization method. Analysis of the point spread function of our image
formation method shows that reflectivity images are focused when the motion
parameters are estimated correctly. We present analysis of the velocity
resolution and the resolution of reconstructed reflectivity images. We analyze
the error between the correct and reconstructed position of targets due to
errors in velocity estimation. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the
performance of our method and validate the theoretical results.

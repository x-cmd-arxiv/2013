find that hole-doped Cu2O has a high thermopower of above 200 microV/K even

heavy valence bands of Cu2O. This is reminiscent of the cobaltate family of

and GZK cutoff. The visible manifestations of these spectral features are
ankle, beginning of GZK cutoff in the differential spectrum and E_{1/2} in
integral spectrum. Observed in all experiments, the ankle is usually
interpreted as transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays. Using the
mass composition measured by HiRes, Telescope Array (TA) and Auger detectors at
energy (1-3) EeV, calculated anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays at these
energies, and the elongation curves we strongly argue against the
interpretation of the ankle given above. The transition must occur at lower
energy, most probably at the second knee as the dip model predicts. The other
prediction of this model, the shape of the dip, is well confirmed by HiRes, TA,
AGASA and Yakutsk detectors, and, after recalibration of energies, by Auger
detector. Predicted beginning of GZK cutoff and E_{1/2} agree well with HiRes
and TA data. However, directly measured mass composition remains a puzzle.
While HiRes and TA detectors observe the proton-dominated mass composition, as
required by the dip model, the data of Auger detector strongly evidence for
nuclei mass composition becoming steadily heavier at energy higher than 4 EeV
and reaching Iron at energy about 35 EeV. The Auger-based scenario is
consistent with another interpretation of the ankle at energy E_a=4 EeV as
transition from extragalactic protons to extragalactic nuclei. The heavy-
nuclei dominance at higher energies may be provided by low-energy of
acceleration for protons E_{max} \sim 4 EeV and rigidity-dependent E_{max}^A =Z
E_{max}$ for nuclei. The highest energy suppression may be explained as
nuclei-destroying cutoff.

interaction ruling animal collective behavior depends on topological rather

the topological model, defined as the convergence of the agents' velocities to
a common vector. The shift from metric to topological interactions requires
development of new analytical methods, taking into account the
graph-theoretical nature of the problem. Moreover, we provide a rigorous
derivation of the mean-field limit of large populations, recovering kinetic and

discussed: the objective function, the survivor selection operator and the

that construct the solution of the problem in traditional way is used. However,
this function is embedded into the evolutionary algorithm that serves as a

local search heuristics. The new neutral selection operator has been developed
that is capable to deal with neutral solutions, i.e. solutions that have the
different representation but expose the equal values of objective function. The
aim of this operator is to directs the evolutionary search into a new

more flexibility to tradeoff between the complexity of the relay mapper and the
rate performance. It is shown that, in order to approach the rate performance

crucial to use a new K-stage coset decoder for structured O-MLC, instead of the
one-stage decoder proposed in previous works. However, if O-MLC is decoded with
the one-stage decoder only, it can still achieve the optimal DDF
diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime.
As for MS-MLC, its rate performance can approach that of the O-MLC by
increasing the complexity of the modulo-sum relay-mapper. Finally, for
practical implementations of both O-MLC and MS-MLC, practical short length
lattice codes with linear mappers are designed, which facilitate efficient
lattice decoding. Simulation results show that the proposed coding schemes
outperform existing schemes in terms of outage probabilities in a variety of
channel settings.

genotype-phenotype mapping, a swap local search heuristic, and a neutral
survivor selection operator. This algorithm was compared with the evolutionary
algorithm with the SAW method of Eiben et al., the Tabucol algorithm of Hertz
and de Werra, and the hybrid evolutionary algorithm of Galinier and Hao. The
performance of these algorithms were tested on a test suite consisting of
randomly generated 3-colorable graphs of various structural features, such as
graph size, type, edge density, and variability in sizes of color classes.
Furthermore, the test graphs were generated including the phase transition
where the graphs are hard to color. The purpose of the extensive experimental
work was threefold: to investigate the behavior of the tested algorithms in the
phase transition, to identify what impact hybridization with the DSatur
traditional heuristic has on the evolutionary algorithm, and to show how graph
structural features influence the performance of the graph-coloring algorithms.
The results indicate that the performance of the hybrid self-adaptive
evolutionary algorithm is comparable with, or better than, the performance of
the hybrid evolutionary algorithm which is one of the best graph-coloring
algorithms today. Moreover, the fact that all the considered algorithms
performed poorly on flat graphs confirms that this type of graphs is really the
hardest to color.

corresponds to the well-known Burgers hierarchy. The case of a linear viscous
central invariant provides a viscous analog of the Camassa-Holm equation, that

construct asymptotic solutions via an extension of the quasi-Miura map that
preserves the initial datum. The method is alternative to the method of the
string equation for Hamiltonian conservation laws and naturally extends to the

the receiver processing in the uplink relies on the channel estimates which are
known to suffer from pilot interference. In this work, we perform an uplink
large system analysis of multi-cell multi-antenna system when the receiver
employs a matched filtering with a pilot contaminated estimate. We find the
asymptotic Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) as the number of
antennas and number of users per base station grow large while maintaining a
fixed ratio. To do this, we make use of the similarity of the uplink received
signal in a multi-antenna system to the representation of the received signal
in CDMA systems. The asymptotic SINR expression explicitly captures the effect
of pilot contamination and that of interference averaging. This also explains
the SINR performance of receiver processing schemes at different regimes such
as instances when the number of antennas are comparable to number of users as
well as when antennas exceed greatly the number of users. Finally, we also
propose that the adaptive MMSE symbol detection scheme, which does not require

network. A major obstacle that poses an existential threat to practical
deployment of conventional approaches to distributed coding is the exponential
growth of the decoder complexity with the number of sources and the encoding
rates. This growth in complexity renders many traditional approaches
impractical even for moderately sized networks. In this paper, we propose a new
decoding paradigm for large scale distributed compression wherein the decoder
complexity is explicitly controlled during the design. Central to our approach
is a module called the ""bit-subset selector"" whose role is to judiciously
extract an appropriate subset of the received bits for decoding per individual
source. We propose a practical design strategy, based on deterministic
annealing (DA) for the joint design of the system components, that enables
direct optimization of the decoder complexity-distortion trade-off, and thereby
the desired scalability. We also point out the direct connections between the
problem of large scale distributed compression and a related problem in sensor
networks, namely, dispersive information routing of correlated sources. This
allows us to extend the design principles proposed in the context of large
scale distributed compression to design efficient routers for minimum cost
communication of correlated sources across a network. Experiments on both real

default reasoning, we focus the study on the logical operation of quasi
conjunction and the Goodman-Nguyen inclusion relation for conditional events.
We recall that quasi conjunction is a basic notion for defining consistency of
conditional knowledge bases. By deepening some results given in a previous
paper we show that, given any finite family of conditional events F and any
nonempty subset S of F, the family F p-entails the quasi conjunction C(S);
then, given any conditional event E|H, we analyze the equivalence between
p-entailment of E|H from F and p-entailment of E|H from C(S), where S is some
nonempty subset of F. We also illustrate some alternative theorems related with
p-consistency and p-entailment. Finally, we deepen the study of the connections
between the notions of p-entailment and inclusion relation by introducing for a
pair (F,E|H) the (possibly empty) class K of the subsets S of F such that C(S)
implies E|H. We show that the class K satisfies many properties; in particular
K is additive and has a greatest element which can be determined by applying a
suitable algorithm.

that was applied in the preceding article (part I) to Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi
(LTB) models. By introducing an initial value parametrization, we show that all
LTB scalars that take a FLRW ""look alike"" form (frequently used in the
literature dealing with LTB models) follow as q-averages of covariant scalars
that are common to FLRW models. These q--scalars determine for every averaging
domain a unique FLRW background state through Darmois matching conditions at
the domain boundary, though the definition of this background does not require
an actual matching with a FLRW region (Swiss cheese type models). Local
perturbations describe the deviation from the FLRW background state through the
local gradients of covariant scalars at the boundary of every comoving domain,
while non-local perturbations do so in terms of the intuitive notion of a
""contrast"" of local scalars with respect to FLRW reference values that emerge
from q-averages assigned to the whole domain or the whole time slice in the
asymptotic limit. We derive fluid flow evolution equations that completely
determine the dynamics of the models in terms of the q-scalars and both types
of perturbations. A rigorous formalism of exact spherical non-linear
perturbations is defined over the FLRW background state associated to the
q-scalars, recovering the standard results of linear perturbation theory in the
appropriate limit. We examine the notion of the amplitude and illustrate the
differences between local vs non-local perturbations by qualitative diagrams
and through an example of a cosmic density void that follows from the numeric
solution of the evolution equations.

  matures from a buoyant nymph to a grounded adult",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to understand how animals evolved over time, biologists must learn
how their body parts form during their development. The following is a detailed
description of how one species of sea spider transforms from a hatchling to an
8-legged adult. Pycnogonids, or sea spiders, comprise a primitive lineage of
arthropods. As such, they hold potential to reveal insights into arthropod
evolution. Recent phylogenetic analyses have supported their position as either
basal chelicerates or as a separate, fifth major lineage of extant arthropods.
Disagreements concerning pycnogonid relations to other arthropods is partly a
product of too few primary observations of pycnogonid anatomy and development.
This investigation of post-embryonic development of the pycnogonid
Anoplodactylus eroticus employs multiple techniques of anatomical observation,
including Nomarski optics, scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence
microscopy, in order to thoroughly document the life cycle.
  After the second post-embryonic stage, larvae of A. eroticus burrow within a
hydroid and undergo morphogenesis. Larvae emerge from the hydroid and
simultaneously molt into the juvenile stage. Over the course of post-embryonic
development there are eight stages preceding the mature adult. All structures,
except for the anteriormost appendages, the chelifores, undergo some degree of
transformation. Chelifores are present prior to hatching and remain mobile over
the course of development. Some larger issues important to arthropod evolution
are addressed, such as the equivalent of a germband and labrum in pycnogonids.
Post-embryonic development of A. eroticus provides an example counteracting
previous reports of anamorphic development and a four-segmented head in the
pycnogonid ground pattern, findings that were extrapolated to fit the ground
pattern of Arthropoda.

solve hyperbolic conservation laws are designed assuming one-dimensional
uniform grids, and they are also used to compute slope limiters in computations
on non-uniform rectilinear grids. However, this strategy may lead to either
loss of total variation diminishing (TVD) stability for 1D linear problems or
the loss of formal second-order accuracy if the grid is highly non-uniform.
This is especially true when the limiter function is not piecewise linear.
Numerical evidences are provided to support this argument for two popular
finite volume strategies: MUSCL in space and method of lines in time
(MUSCL-MOL), and capacity-form differencing. In order to deal with this issue,
this paper presents a general approach to study and enhance the slope limiter
functions for highly non-uniform grids in the MUSCL-MOL framework. This
approach extends the classical reconstruct-evolve-project procedure to general
grids, and it gives sufficient conditions for a slope limiter function leading
to a TVD stable, formal second-order accuracy in space, and symmetry preserving
numerical scheme on arbitrary grids. Several widely used limiter functions,
including the smooth ones by van Leer and van Albada, are enhanced to satisfy
these conditions. These properties are confirmed by solving various
one-dimensional and two-dimensional benchmark problems using the enhanced
limiters on highly non-uniform rectilinear grids.

The auto propagated contours on the treatment CT may contain relatively large

to meet the clinical requirement for adaptive therapy; however, the DVF is
still inaccurate and inconsistent with the edited contours. The purpose of this

algorithm is realized by regularizing the objective function of the original

the conformational dynamics of proteins and other biomolecules. MSMs are
typically built from numerous molecular dynamics simulations by dividing the
sampled configurations into a large number of microstates based on geometric
criteria. The resulting microstate model can then be coarse-grained into a more
understandable macro state model by lumping together rapidly mixing microstates
into larger, metastable aggregates. However, finite sampling often results in
the creation of many poorly sampled microstates. During coarse-graining, these
states are mistakenly identified as being kinetically important because
transitions to/from them appear to be slow. In this paper we propose a
formalism based on an algebraic principle for matrix approximation, i.e. the
Nystrom method, to deal with such poorly sampled microstates. Our scheme builds
a hierarchy of microstates from high to low populations and progressively
applies spectral clustering on sets of microstates within each level of the
hierarchy. It helps spectral clustering identify metastable aggregates with
highly populated microstates rather than being distracted by lowly populated
states. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to discover the major
metastable states on two model systems, the alanine dipeptide and TrpZip2.

for static graph reachability, many real-world graphs are constantly evolving,
which calls for dynamic indexing. In this paper, we present a fully dynamic
reachability index over dynamic graphs. Our method, called DAGGER, is a
light-weight index based on interval labeling, that scales to million node
graphs and beyond. Our extensive experimental evaluation on real-world and
synthetic graphs confirms its effectiveness over baseline methods.

fit to the total stellar mass contained within spheroid and disc structures as
recently reported by the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue team. Three interesting
inferences can be made following our axioms: (1) there is a transition redshift
at z ~ 1.7 at which point the Universe switches from what we refer to as ""hot
mode evolution"" (i.e., spheroid formation/growth via mergers and/or collapse)
to what we term ""cold mode evolution"" (i.e., disc formation/growth via gas
infall and minor mergers); (2) there is little or no need for any
pre-enrichment prior to the main phase of star-formation; (3) in the present
Universe mass-loss is fairly evenly balanced with star-formation holding the
integrated stellar mass density close to a constant value.
  The model provides a simple prediction of the energy output from spheroid and
disc projenitors, the build-up of spheroid and disc mass, and the mean
metallicity enrichment of the Universe.

the mechanisms and processes of energy accumulation and sudden release in ARs
and to improve our capability of space weather prediction. Although some case
studies have been made, the question is still far from fully answered. This
issue is now being tried to address statistically through an investigation of
waiting times of quasi-homologous CMEs from super ARs in solar cycle 23. It is
found that the waiting times of quasi-homologous CMEs have a two-component
distribution with a separation at about 18 hours. The first component is a
Gaussian-like distribution with a peak at about 7 hours, which indicates a
tight physical connection between these quasi-homologous CMEs. The likelihood
of occurrences of two or more CMEs faster than 1200 km s-1 from the same AR
within 18 hours is about 20%. Furthermore, the correlation analysis among CME
waiting times, CME speeds and CME occurrence rates reveals that these
quantities are independent to each other, suggesting that the perturbation by
preceding CMEs rather than free energy input be the direct cause of
quasi-homologous CMEs. The peak waiting time of 7 hours probably characterize
the time scale of the growth of instabilities triggered by preceding CMEs. This
study uncovers more clues from a statistical perspective for us to understand
quasi-homologous CMEs as well as CME-rich ARs.

intrinsic frequencies for NGC2264VAS20 and NGC2264VAS 87, respectively, in the
range from 0 to 1.5c/d which are attributed to be caused by a combination of

of the two stars to the cluster is confirmed independently using X-ray fluxes,
radial velocity measurements and proper motions available in the literature.

Mechanical fingerprinting studies of a series of C-terminally truncated

varying native constraints, potential energy change upon mutation,
frustratometer analysis, and analysis of the coupling between local frustration

stresses are partially relieved by mutation but at the expense of metal-binding
affinity, and that the frustration of a residue is directly related to its role
in binding metals. This evidence points to apo SOD1 as a strained intermediate
with ""self-allostery"" for high metal-binding affinity. Thus, the prerequisites

emergence of specific output features such as orientation tuning. Tuning and
selectivity of cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex is not equivocally
resolved so far. While many in-vivo experimental studies found inhibitory
neurons of all subtypes to be broadly tuned for orientation other studies
report inhibitory neurons that are as sharply tuned as excitatory neurons.
These diverging findings about the selectivity of excitatory and inhibitory
cortical neurons prompted us to ask the following questions: (1) How different
or similar is the cortical computation with that in previously described
species that relies on map? (2) What is the network mechanism underlying the
sharpening of orientation selectivity in the mouse primary visual cortex? Here,
we investigate the above questions in a computational framework with a
recurrent network composed of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) point neurons. Our cortical
network with random connectivity alone could not account for all the
experimental observations, which led us to hypothesize, (a) Orientation
dependent connectivity (b) Feedforward afferent specificity to understand
orientation selectivity of V1 neurons in mouse. Using population (orientation
selectivity index) OSI as a measure of neuronal selectivity to stimulus
orientation we test each hypothesis separately and in combination against
experimental data. Based on our analysis of orientation selectivity (OS) data
we find a good fit of network parameters in a model based on afferent
specificity and connectivity that scales with feature similarity. We conclude
that this particular model class best supports data sets of orientation
selectivity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in layer 2/3 of primary visual
cortex of mouse.

matches. In Strata I, the keypoints from gallery and probe iris images are
paired using traditional SIFT approach. Due to high image similarity at
different regions of iris there may be some impairments. These are detected and
filtered by finding gradient of paired keypoints in Strata II. Further, the
scaling factor of paired keypoints is used to remove impairments in Strata III.
The pairs retained after Strata III are likely to be potential matches for iris
recognition. The proposed system performs with an accuracy of 96.08% and 97.15%
on publicly available CASIAV3 and BATH databases respectively. This marks
significant improvement of accuracy and FAR over the existing SIFT matching for
iris.

networks in which multiple source-destination pairs communicate confidential
messages, to be kept confidential from the intermediate nodes. We pose the
problem as that of network utility maximization, into which confidentiality is
incorporated as an additional quality of service constraint. We develop a
simple, and yet provably optimal dynamic control algorithm that combines flow
control, routing and end-to-end secrecy-encoding. In order to achieve
confidentiality, our scheme exploits multipath diversity and temporal diversity
due to channel variability. Our end-to-end dynamic encoding scheme encodes
confidential messages across multiple packets, to be combined at the ultimate
destination for recovery. We first develop an optimal dynamic policy for the
case in which the number of blocks across which secrecy encoding is performed
is asymptotically large. Next, we consider encoding across a finite number of
packets, which eliminates the possibility of achieving perfect secrecy. For
this case, we develop a dynamic policy to choose the encoding rates for each
message, based on the instantaneous channel state information, queue states and
secrecy outage requirements. By numerical analysis, we observe that the
proposed scheme approaches the optimal rates asymptotically with increasing
block size. Finally, we address the consequences of practical implementation
issues such as infrequent queue updates and de-centralized scheduling. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our policies by numerical studies under various
network conditions.

  Answering",,,,,"cs.DB cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An uncertain database is defined as a relational database in which primary
keys need not be satisfied. A repair (or possible world) of such database is
obtained by selecting a maximal number of tuples without ever selecting two
distinct tuples with the same primary key value. For a Boolean query q, the
decision problem CERTAINTY(q) takes as input an uncertain database db and asks
whether q is satisfied by every repair of db. Our main focus is on acyclic
Boolean conjunctive queries without self-join. Previous work has introduced the
notion of (directed) attack graph of such queries, and has proved that
CERTAINTY(q) is first-order expressible if and only if the attack graph of q is
acyclic. The current paper investigates the boundary between tractability and
intractability of CERTAINTY(q). We first classify cycles in attack graphs as
either weak or strong, and then prove among others the following. If the attack
graph of a query q contains a strong cycle, then CERTAINTY(q) is coNP-complete.
If the attack graph of q contains no strong cycle and every weak cycle of it is
terminal (i.e., no edge leads from a vertex in the cycle to a vertex outside
the cycle), then CERTAINTY(q) is in P. We then partially address the only
remaining open case, i.e., when the attack graph contains some nonterminal
cycle and no strong cycle. Finally, we establish a relationship between the
complexities of CERTAINTY(q) and evaluating q on probabilistic databases.

physical admissibility requirements, and split into different families
according to the behaviour of these lagrangian density functions in vacuum and
on the boundary of their domains of definition. Depending on these behaviours
the flat-space energy of the ESS field can be finite or divergent. For each
model we qualitatively study the structure of its associated gravitational
configurations, which can be asymptotically \emph{Schwarzschild-like} or with
an anomalous \emph{non Schwarzschild-like} behaviour at $r \rightarrow \infty$
(but being asymptotically flat and well behaved anyhow). The extension of these
results to the non-abelian case is also briefly considered.

the attraction basin via competing behaviors of certain parameters. The
boundaries of attraction arise in the various limits where these parameters
degenerate to zero. We find that these boundaries are generalizations of the
recently introduced (extremal) subtracted geometry: the warp factors still
exhibit asymptotic integer power law behaviors, but the powers can be different
from one. As we cross over one of these boundaries (""generalized

also solve a simpler theory where the attraction basin is lower dimensional and
easy to visualize, and present a simple picture that illustrates many of the

a tremendous progress. In the relativistic heavy ion accelerators, specially
the RHIC and LHC colliders, it became possible to study not only fluids made of
hadronic matter but also fluids of quarks and gluons. Part of the physics
program of these machines is the observation of waves in this strongly
interacting medium. From the theoretical point of view, these waves are often
treated with li-nearized hydrodynamics. In this text we review the attempts to
go beyond linearization. We show how to use the Reductive Perturbation Method
to expand the equations of (ideal and viscous) relativistic hydrodynamics to
obtain nonlinear wave equations. These nonlinear wave equations govern the
evolution of energy density perturbations (in hot quark gluon plasma) or baryon
density perturbations (in cold quark gluon plasma and nuclear matter).
Different nonlinear wave equations, such as the breaking wave, Korteweg-de
Vries and Burgers equations, are obtained from different equations of state
(EOS). In nuclear matter, the Walecka EOS may lead to a KdV equation. We
explore equations of state such as those extracted from the MIT Bag Model and
from QCD in the mean field theory approach. Some of these equations are
integrable and have analytical solitonic solutions. We derive these equations
also in spherical and cylindrical coordinates. We extend the analysis to two
and three dimensions to obtain the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation, which
is the generalization of the KdV. The KP is also integrable and presents
analytical solitonic solutions. In viscous relativistic hydrodynamics we have
second order patial derivatives which physically represent dissipation terms.
We present numerical solutions and their corresponding algorithms for the cases
where the equations are not integrable.

order to obtain a sparse solution that takes into account the biological

classical notion of regularity. A cost function associates to each input a
non-negative integer value (or infinity), as opposed to languages which only
associate to each input the two values ""inside"" and ""outside"". This theory is a
continuation of the works on distance automata and similar models. These models
of automata have been successfully used for solving the star-height problem,
the finite power property, the finite substitution problem, the relative
inclusion star-height problem and the boundedness problem for monadic-second
order logic over words. Our notion of regularity can be -- as in the classical
theory of regular languages -- equivalently defined in terms of automata,
expressions, algebraic recognisability, and by a variant of the monadic
second-order logic. These equivalences are strict extensions of the
corresponding classical results. The present paper introduces the cost monadic
logic, the quantitative extension to the notion of monadic second-order logic
we use, and show that some problems of existence of bounds are decidable for
this logic. This is achieved by introducing the corresponding algebraic
formalism: stabilisation monoids.

repulsive interaction (diameter sigma) is studied with a liquid-theoretical
approach. The mean square displacement, the two-particle displacement
correlation, and the overlap-density-based generalized susceptibility are
calculated analytically by way of the Lagrangian correlation of the
interparticulate space, instead of the Eulerian correlation of density that is
commonly used in the standard mode-coupling theory. In regard to the mean
square displacement, the linear analysis reproduces the established result on
the asymptotic subdiffusive behavior of the system. A finite-time correction is
given by incorporating the effect of entropic nonlinearity with a Lagrangian
version of mode-coupling theory. The notorious difficulty in derivation of the
mode-coupling theory concerning violation of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem is found to disappear by virtue of the Lagrangian description. The
Lagrangian description also facilitates analytical calculation of four-point
correlations in the space-time, such as the two-particle displacement
correlation. The two-particle displacement correlation, which is asymptotically
self-similar in the space-time, illustrates how the cage effect confines each
particle within a short radius on one hand and creates collective motion of
numerous particles on the other hand. As the time elapses, the correlation
length grows unlimitedly, and the generalized susceptibility based on the
overlap density converges to a finite value which is an increasing function of
the density. The distribution function behind these dynamical four-point
correlations and its extension to three-dimensional cases, respecting the
tensorial character of the two-particle displacement correlation, are also
discussed.

dark matter relic density in cases of thermal underproduction as well as

ground state degeneracy and quasi-particles carrying fractional quantum numbers
and fractional statistics. The topological spin $\theta_a=2\pi h_a$ is an
important property of a topological quasi-particle, which is the Berry phase
obtained in the adiabatic self-rotation of the quasi-particle by $2\pi$. For
chiral topological states with robust chiral edge states, another fundamental
topological property is the edge state chiral central charge $c$. In this paper
we propose a new approach to compute the topological spin and chiral central
charge in lattice models by defining a new quantity named as the momentum
polarization. Momentum polarization is defined on the cylinder geometry as a
universal subleading term in the average value of a ""partial translation
operator"". We show that the momentum polarization is a quantum entanglement
property which can be computed from the reduced density matrix, and our
analytic derivation based on edge conformal field theory shows that the
momentum polarization measures the combination $h_a-\frac{c}{24}$ of
topological spin and central charge. Numerical results are obtained for two
example systems, the non-Abelian phase of the honeycomb lattice Kitaev model,
and the $\nu=1/2$ Laughlin state of a fractional Chern insulator described by a
variational Monte Carlo wavefunction. The numerical results verifies the
analytic formula with high accuracy, and further suggests that this result
remains robust even when the edge states cannot be described by a conformal
field theory. Our result provides a new efficient approach to characterize and
identify topological states of matter from finite size numerics.

However, little is known about the minimal regularity needed to analyze curves

techniques such as a differentiable exponential map etc. are available nor
(generalized) curvature bounds are imposed. In this paper we advance
low-regularity Riemannian geometry by investigating general length structures
on manifolds that are equipped with Riemannian metrics of low regularity. We
generalize the length structure by proving that the class of absolutely
continuous curves induces the standard metric space structure. The main result
states that the arc-length of absolutely continuous curves is the same as the
length induced by the metric. For the proof we use techniques from the analysis
of metric spaces and employ specific smooth approximations of continuous
Riemannian metrics. We thus show that when dealing with lengths of curves, the
metric approach for low-regularity Riemannnian manifolds is still compatible
with standard definitions and can successfully fill in for lack of
differentiability.

large splitting between the gluino and the wino LSP masses resulting in tight

fields into this framework to obtain a hybrid theory of gauge and anomaly
mediation, solving both problems simultaneously. Specifically, we find any
number of vector-like messenger fields (allowed by GUT unification) compress
the predicted gaugino spectrum when their masses come from the Giudice-Masiero

loop-suppressed gaugino masses in gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking,
relic dark matter density from $\sim$ TeV mass gauginos, together with the
success of supersymmetric gauge coupling unification, suggest that scalar
superpartner masses are roughly $m_{sc} \sim$ 100-1000 TeV. Higgsino masses, if
not at the Planck scale, should generically appear at the same scale. The
gaugino mass contributions from anomaly mediation, with the heavy Higgsino
threshold, generally leads to a more compressed spectrum than standard anomaly
mediation, while the presence of extra vector-like matter near $m_{sc}$
typically leads to an even more compressed spectrum. Heavy Higgsinos improve
gauge coupling unification relative to the MSSM. Heavy scalars suggest new
possibilities for flavor physics -- large flavor violations in the soft masses
are now allowed, yielding interesting levels for new FCNC's, and re-opening the
attractive possibility of a radiatively generated fermion mass hierarchy.
Gluinos and binos/winos must decay through higher dimension operators, giving a
unique handle on the presence of new physics the scale $m_{sc}$. Gluino decays
should be spectacular, for example yielding events with four tops -- at
modestly displaced vertices -- and two Higgses plus missing energy. The high
scale $m_{sc}$ can also be probed in flavor-violating gluino decays, as well as
a specific pattern of gluino branching ratios to the third generation. Finally,
with heavy Higgsinos, the dominant decay for neutral winos and binos proceeds
via the Higgs $\tilde b \to \tilde w h$. The heaviness of the Higgsinos can be
inferred from the branching ratio for the rare decay $\tilde b \to \tilde w Z$.

points and their weights, or equivalently on the set of atomic measures. It
consists of two terms; the first term is the sum of the square root of the
weights, and the second is the quadratic optimal transport cost between the
atomic measure and the Lebesgue measure.
  We prove that this system admits crystallization in several different ways:
(1) the energy is bounded from below by the energy of a triangular lattice
(called $\mathcal T$); (2) if the energy equals that of $\mathcal T$, then the
measure is a rotated and translated copy of $\mathcal T$; (3) if the energy is
close to that of $\mathcal T$, then locally the measure is close to a rotated
and translated copy of $\mathcal T$. These three results require the domain to
be a polygon with at most six sides. A fourth result states that the energy of
$\mathcal T$ can be achieved in the limit of large domains, for domains with
arbitrary boundaries.
  The proofs make use of three ingredients. First, the optimal transport cost
associates to each point a polygonal cell; the energy can be bounded from below
by a sum over all cells of a function that depends only on the cell. Second,
this function has a convex lower bound that is sharp at $\mathcal T$. Third,
Euler's polytope formula limits the average number of sides of the polygonal
cells to six, where six is the number corresponding to the triangular lattice.

be solved by going beyond the operational quantum formalism. In our ""prequantum
model"" quantum systems are symbolic representations of classical random fields.
The Schr\""odinger's dynamics is a special form of the linear dynamics of
classical fields. Measurements are described as interactions of classical
fields with detectors. Discontinuity, the ""collapse of the wave function"", has
the trivial origin: usage of threshold type detectors. The von Neumann
projection postulate can be interpreted as the formal mathematical encoding of
the absence of coincidence detection in measurement on a single quantum system,
e.g., photon's polarization measurement. Our model, prequantum classical
statistical field theory (PCSFT), in combination with measurements by threshold
detectors satisfies the quantum restriction on coincidence detections: the
second order coherence is less than one (opposite to all known semiclassical
and classical feld models). The basic rule of quantum probability, the Born's
rule, is derived from properties of prequantum random felds interacting with
threshold type detectors. Comparison with De Broglie's views to quantum
mechanics as theory of physical waves with singularities is presented.

properties of a sample of 17 highly radio-loud quasars (HRLQs) at z > 4 with
sensitive X-ray coverage from new Chandra and archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, and
Swift observations. Eight of the new and archival observations are reported in
this work for the first time. New Chandra observations of two moderately
radio-loud and highly optically luminous quasars at z > 4 are also reported.
Our HRLQ sample represents the top ~5% of radio-loud quasars in terms of radio
loudness. We found that our HRLQs have an X-ray emission enhancement over HRLQs
at lower redshifts (by a typical factor of ~3), and this effect, after
controlling for several factors which may introduce biases, has been solidly
estimated to be significant at the 3-4 sigma level. HRLQs at z=3-4 are also
found to have a similar X-ray emission enhancement over z < 3 HRLQs, which
supports further the robustness of our results. We discuss models for the X-ray
enhancement's origin including a fractional contribution from inverse Compton
scattering of cosmic microwave background photons. No strong correlations are
found between the relative X-ray brightness and optical/UV emission-line
rest-frame equivalent widths (REWs) for radio-loud quasars. However, the line
REWs are positively correlated with radio loudness, which suggests that
relativistic jets make a negligible contribution to the optical/UV continua of
these HRLQs (contrary to the case where the emission lines are diluted by the
relativistically boosted continuum). Our HRLQs are generally consistent with
the known anti-correlation between radio loudness and X-ray power-law photon
index. We also found that the two moderately radio-loud quasars appear to have
the hardest X-ray spectra among our objects, suggesting that intrinsic X-ray
absorption (N_H~10^23 cm^-2) may be present.

electroweak (EW) and electromagnetic (EM) bremsstrahlung removes this s-wave
suppression. The main purpose of this talk is to explain in some detail why the
branching ratio to a fermion pair is likely suppressed while the decay to the
pair plus a W/Z is not. In doing so, we investigate the general conditions for
s-wave suppression and un-suppression using Fierz transformations and partial
wave expansions. Suppression for the 2-to-2 process is sufficiently severe that
the EW and EM bremsstrahlung are likely to be the dominant modes of
gauge-singlet Majorana DM annihilation. We end this talk with a discussion of
the challenge presented by space-based data for Majorana DM models, given that
the enhanced rate to radiated W and Z gauge bosons and their dominant decay via
hadronic channels tends to produce more anti-protons than are observed.

us with a rare opportunity: five planets transit this star giving us an
expansive view of its architecture. All five planets of this compact system
orbit their host star within a distance one third the size of Mercury's orbit
with the innermost planet positioned a mere 4.3 stellar radii from the stellar

us to validate the entire Kepler-32 system making it the richest known system
of transiting planets around an M dwarf. Based on considerations of the stellar
dust sublimation radius, the near period commensurability of three adjacent
planets, a minimum mass protoplanetary nebula, and the volatile content
inferred for the planets, we propose that the Kepler-32 planets formed at
larger orbital radii and migrated inward to their present locations. The
volatile content inferred for the Kepler-32 planets and order of magnitude
estimates for the disk migration rates suggest these planets may have formed
beyond the snow line and migrated in the presence of a gaseous disk. The
Kepler-32 planets are representative of the full ensemble of planet candidates
orbiting the Kepler M dwarfs for which we calculate an occurrence rate of 1.0

with substantially lower end electrodes potential than conventional
Penning-Malmberg traps, which makes this trap quite portable. It was
computationally shown that each microtrap with 50 micron radius stored
positrons with a density (1.6x10^11 cm^-3) even higher than that in
conventional Penning-Malmberg traps (about 10^11 cm^-3) while the confinement
voltage was only 10 V. It was presented in this work how to evaluate and lower
the numerical noise by controlling the modeling parameters so the simulated
plasma can evolve toward computational equilibrium. The local equilibrium
distribution, where longitudinal force balance is satisfied along each magnetic
field line, was attained in time scales of the simulation for plasmas
initialized with a uniform density and Boltzmann energy distribution. The
charge clouds developed the expected radial soft edge density distribution and
rigid rotation evolved to some extent. To reach global equilibrium (i.e. rigid
rotation) longer runs are required. The plasma confinement time and its
thermalization were independent of the length. The length-dependency, reported
in experiments, is due to fabrication and field errors. Computationally, more

Furthermore, their model checking verification typically becomes unfeasible due
to the huge state space explosion caused by the system's concurrency. The PALS
(""physically asynchronous, logically synchronous"") methodology has been
proposed to reduce the design and verification of a DCPS to the much simpler
task of designing and verifying its underlying synchronous version. The
original PALS methodology assumes a single logical period, but Multirate PALS
extends it to deal with multirate DCPS in which components may operate with
different logical periods. This paper shows how Multirate PALS can be applied
to formally verify a nontrivial multirate DCPS. We use Real-Time Maude to
formally specify a multirate distributed hybrid system consisting of an
airplane maneuvered by a pilot who turns the airplane according to a specified
angle through a distributed control system. Our formal analysis revealed that
the original design was ineffective in achieving a smooth turning maneuver, and
led to a redesign of the system that satisfies the desired correctness
properties. This shows that the Multirate PALS methodology is not only
effective for formal DCPS verification, but can also be used effectively in the
DCPS design process, even before properties are verified.

that processor and memory system communicate through a universal and flexible

demonstrated that the only stable fixed point (attractor) of the non-singular

that, contrary to the established theory, bubble selection in a Hele-Shaw cell
does not require surface tension. The solutions reported here significantly
extend previous results for a simply-connected geometry (finger) to a

PA is exact for this first model. For the second, we obtain constraints on the

$\varepsilon$ and characteristic convergence $\kappa_s$) such that the PA is
accurate for the aforementioned quantities. In this process we obtain analytic
expressions for several lensing functions, which are valid for the PA in
general. The determination of this domain of validity could have significant
implications for the use of the PA, but it still needs to be probed with

with the presence of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$). Therefore it would be
important to investigate its implication on galaxy formation in a cosmological
context. In the present work, we track the H$_2$ mass fraction within our
cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-3 using an
equilibrium analytic model by Krumholz et al. This model allows us to regulate
the star formation in our simulation by the local abundance of H$_2$ rather
than the total cold gas density, and naturally introduce the dependence of star
formation on metallicity. We investigate implications of the equilibrium
H$_2$-based SF model on galaxy population properties, such as the
stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR), baryon fraction, cosmic star formation rate
density (SFRD), galaxy specific SFR, galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMF), and
Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relationship. The advantage of our work over the
previous ones is having a large sample of simulated galaxies in a cosmological
volume from high-redshift to $z=0$. We find that low-mass halos with
M$_{DM}<10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$ are less efficient in producing stars in the
H$_2$-based SF model at $z\geq6$, which brings the simulations to a better
agreement with observational estimates of SHMR and GSMF at the low-mass end.
This is particularly evident by a reduction in the number of low-mass galaxies
at M$_\star\leq10^{8}$ M$_\odot$ in the GSMF. The overall SFRD is also reduced
at high-$z$ in the H$_2$ run, which results in slightly higher SFRD at
low-redshift due to more abundant gas available for star formation at later
times. This new H$_2$ model is able to reproduce the empirical KS relationship
at $z=0$ naturally without the need for setting its normalization by hand, and
overall it seems to have more advantages than the previous pressure-based SF
model.

algorithms, some of which are supposed to be more powerful in terms of better
convergence and lower error compared to the commonly used Backpropagation
algorithm. The results obtained suggest that Levenberg-Marquardt method
outperforms all other methods in the ANN domain. Applying this ANN algorithm to
$\sim$ 101.44 h of Crab Nebula data collected by the TACTIC telescope, during
Nov. 10, 2005 - Jan. 30, 2006, yields an excess of $\sim$ (1141$\pm$106) with a
statistical significance of $\sim$ 11.07$\sigma$, as against an excess of

accruing from the ANN methodology is that it is more effective at higher

optics. Via the manipulation of inhomogeneous acoustic impedance, extraordinary
reflection can be tailored for unprecedented wavefront manipulation while
ordinary reflection can be surprisingly switched on or off. Our results may

relationship for the sum of the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density
matrix of $S$ as a function of the size $D_E$ of the Hilbert space of $E$. This
sum decreases as $1/\sqrt{D_E}$ as long as $D_E\gg 1$. This scaling prediction

namely the littlest Higgs model (LH), the littlest Higgs model with T-parity
(LHT-A and LHT-B) and the simplest little Higgs model (SLH), we scan over the
parameter space in the region allowed by current experiments. We find that in
these models the inclusive and exclusive (via gluon-gluon fusion) diphoton and
$ZZ^*$ signal rates of the Higgs boson are always suppressed and approach to
the SM predictions for a large scale $f$. Thus, the $ZZ^*$ signal rate is
within the $1\sigma$ range of the experimental data while the inclusive
diphoton signal rate is always outside the $2\sigma$ range. Especially, in the
LHT-A the diphoton signal rate is outside the $3\sigma$ range of the

the available LHC and Tevatron Higgs data, and find that these models provide
no better global fit to the whole data set (only for some special channels a
better fit can be obtained, specially in the LHT-B).

techniques for sparse recovery. The important case of $F$-minimization has
become of particular interest, for which the exact reconstruction condition
(ERC) in the noiseless setting can be precisely characterized by the null space
property (NSP). However, little work has been done concerning its robust
reconstruction condition (RRC) in the noisy setting. We look at the null space
of the measurement matrix as a point on the Grassmann manifold, and then study
the relation between the ERC and RRC sets, denoted as $\Omega_J$ and
$\Omega_J^r$, respectively. It is shown that $\Omega_J^r$ is the interior of
$\Omega_J$, from which a previous result of the equivalence of ERC and RRC for
$\ell_p$-minimization follows easily as a special case. Moreover, when $F$ is
non-decreasing, it is shown that
$\overline{\Omega}_J\setminus\interior(\Omega_J)$ is a set of measure zero and
of the first category. As a consequence, the probabilities of ERC and RRC are
the same if the measurement matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is randomly generated according
to a continuous distribution. Quantitatively, if the null space
$\mathcal{N}(\bf A)$ lies in the ""$d$-interior"" of $\Omega_J$, then RRC will be
satisfied with the robustness constant
$C=\frac{2+2d}{d\sigma_{\min}(\mathbf{A}^{\top})}$; and conversely if RRC holds
with $C=\frac{2-2d}{d\sigma_{\max}(\mathbf{A}^{\top})}$, then $\mathcal{N}(\bf
A)$ must lie in $d$-interior of $\Omega_J$. We also present several rules for
comparing the performances of different cost functions. Finally, these results
are capitalized to derive achievable tradeoffs between the measurement rate and
robustness with the aid of Gordon's escape through the mesh theorem or a
connection between NSP and the restricted eigenvalue condition.

the allocation of power levels across the relays subject to individual and
global power constraints and the design of linear receivers for interference
suppression. We derive constrained linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)
expressions for the parameter vectors that determine the optimal power levels
across the relays and the linear receivers. In order to solve the proposed
optimization problems, we develop cost-effective algorithms for adaptive joint
power allocation, and estimation of the parameters of the receiver and the
channels. An analysis of the optimization problem is carried out and shows that
the problem can have its convexity enforced by an appropriate choice of the
power constraint parameter, which allows the algorithms to avoid problems with
local minima. A study of the complexity and the requirements for feedback
channels of the proposed algorithms is also included for completeness.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms obtain significant gains
in performance and capacity over existing non-cooperative and cooperative
schemes.

Two fundamental problems in combinatorial number theory are to find lower

under the assumption that $|AB|$ is small. We focus on the extreme case when
$|AB| < |A| + |B|$, and call any such pair $(A,B)$ \emph{critical}.
  In the case when $|G|$ is prime, the Cauchy-Davenport Theorem asserts that
$|AB| \ge \min {|G|, |A| + |B| - 1}$, and Vosper refined this result by
classifying all critical pairs in these groups. For abelian groups, Kneser
proved a natural generalization of Cauchy-Davenport by showing that there
exists $H \le G$ so that $|AB| \ge |A| + |B| - |H|$ and $ABH = AB$. Kemperman
then proved a result which characterizes the structure of all critical pairs in

  University 2012, 114 pages",,,,"hep-ex nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Charge conjugation C is one of the fundamental symmetries in nature which
transforms particles into antiparticles. This symmetry was studied in weak
interaction where it is fully violated, but it is poorly known in the strong
and electromagnetic interactions.
  To this end, in this thesis we investigated eta->pi+pi-pi0 and eta->pi0 e+e-
decays, which might violate charge conjugation symmetry. The violation of C
symmetry in eta->pi+pi-pi0 process could manifest itself as an asymmetry
between energy spectra of charged pions. The eta->pi0 e+e- decay is forbidden
by C symmetry in the first order of electromagnetic interaction, with the
branching ratio on a level of 10^-8. Therefore, observation of a larger
branching ratio could indicate a mechanism involving first order
electromagnetic interaction violating charge conjugation.
  Both decays were investigated by means of the WASA-at-COSY detector operating
at the COSY synchrotron at the Forchungszentrum Julich in Germany. The eta
meson was produced via pp->pp eta reaction at the proton beam momentum of
2.14GeV/c. In total around 5x10^7 eta mesons were collected.
  As a result of the analysis conducted in the framework of this thesis a
Dalitz Plot distribution for the eta->pi+pi-pi0 decay was obtained. From this
distribution we extracted asymmetry parameters sensitive to C symmetry
violation for different isospin values of the final state and we have
established that all are consistent with zero within the obtained accuracy.
  For the eta->pi0 e+e- decay we have not observe signal and thus we estimated
an upper limit for the branching ratio. The established upper limit amounts to
$BR(eta->pi0 e+e-)<3.7x10^-5 at the 90% confidence level. This result is more
precise than previously obtained in other experiments.

teleportation (QET) is protocols for extraction of the zero-point energy out of
one subsystem using information of a remote measurement of another subsystem.
From an operational viewpoint of protocol users, QET can be regarded as an
effective rapid energy transportation without breaking all physical laws
including causality and local energy conservation. In the protocols, the
ground-state entanglement plays a crucial role. In this paper, we show
analytically for a general class of spin-chain systems that the entanglement
entropy is lower bounded by a positive quadratic function of the teleported
energy between the regions of a QET protocol. This supports a general
conjecture that ground-state entanglement is an evident physical resource for

experimentally in diverse types of plasma systems, including
atmospheric-pressure electric arc discharges. However, numerical simulations
reproducing anode pattern formation in arc discharges have proven exceedingly
elusive. Time-dependent three-dimensional thermodynamic nonequilibrium
simulations reveal the spontaneous formation of self-organized patterns of
anode attachment spots in the free-burning arc, a canonical thermal plasma flow
established by a constant DC current between an axi-symmetric electrodes
configuration in the absence of external forcing. The number of spots, their
size, and distribution within the pattern depend on the applied total current
and on the resolution of the spatial discretization, whereas the main
properties of the plasma flow, such as maximum temperatures, velocity, and
voltage drop, depend only on the former. The sensibility of the solution to the
spatial discretization stresses the computational requirements for
comprehensive arc discharge simulations. The obtained anode patterns
qualitatively agree with experimental observations and confirm that the spots
originate at the fringes of the arc - anode attachment. The results imply that
heavy-species - electron energy equilibration, in addition to thermal
instability, has a dominant role in the formation of anode spots in arc
discharges.

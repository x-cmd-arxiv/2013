computers, which would enable distributed quantum information processing and
quantum communication. One model for such a network is based on the
probabilistic measurement of two photons, each entangled with a distant atom or
atomic ensemble, where the atoms represent quantum computing nodes. A second,
deterministic model transfers information directly from a first atom onto a
cavity photon, which carries it over an optical channel to a second atom; a
prototype with neutral atoms has recently been demonstrated. In both cases, the
central challenge is to find an efficient transfer process that preserves the
coherence of the quantum state. Here, following the second scheme, we map the
quantum state of a single ion onto a single photon within an optical cavity.
Using an ion allows us to prepare the initial quantum state in a deterministic
way, while the cavity enables high-efficiency photon generation. The mapping
process is time-independent, allowing us to characterize the interplay between
efficiency and fidelity. As the techniques for coherent manipulation and
storage of multiple ions at a single quantum node are well established, this
process offers a promising route toward networks between ion-based quantum
computers.

towards accurately determining their stellar parameters. Moreover, the
distribution of the orbital parameters provides observational clues to the way
that O-type stars form and to the interactions during their evolution. Aims.
Our objective is to constrain the multiplicity of a sample of O-type stars
belonging to poorly investigated OB associations in the Cygnus complex and for
the first time to provide orbital parameters for binaries identified in our
sample. Such information is relevant to addressing the issue of the binarity in
the context of O-type star formation scenarios. Methods. We performed a
long-term spectroscopic survey of nineteen O-type stars. We searched for radial
velocity variations to unveil binaries on timescales from a few days up to a
few years, on the basis of a large set of optical spectra. Results. We confirm
the binarity for four objects: HD193443, HD228989, HD229234 and HD194649. We
derive for the first time the orbital solutions of three systems, and we
confirm the values of the fourth, showing that these four systems all have
orbital periods shorter than 10 days. Besides these results, we also detect
several objects that show non-periodic line profile variations in some of their
spectral lines. These variations mainly occur in the spectral lines, that are
generally affected by the stellar wind and are not likely to be related to
binarity. Conclusions. The minimal binary fraction in our sample is estimated
to be 21%, but it varies from one OB association to the next. Indeed, 33% of O
stars belonging to CygOB1 are binary systems, 0% in CygOB3, 0% in CygOB8, and
33% in CygOB9. Our spectroscopic investigation also stresses the absence of
long-period systems among the stars in our sample...

modeling M-theory vacua and quantum mechanical observers in the framework of a

measurement processes based on the canonical theory of quantum gravity. In this
paper we deal with several fundamental issues of time: the time-less problem in
canonical quantum gravity; the physical origin of state reductions; and
time-reversal symmetry breaking. We first model the observers and consider the
time-less problem by invoking the time reparametrization symmetry breaking in
the quantum mechanical world as seen by the observers. We next construct the
hidden time variable theory, using a model of the gauged and affinized
S-duality symmetry in type IIB string theory, as the statistical theory of time
and explain the physical origin of state reductions using it. Finally, by the
extension of the time reparametrization symmetry to all of the temporal hidden
variables, we treat the issue of time reversal symmetry breaking as the
spontaneous breaking of this extended time reparametrization symmetry. The
classification of unitary time-dependent processes and the geometrizations of
unitary and non-unitary time evolutions using the language of the derived

transition to the CsCu2Cl3-type structure (Cmcm space group) around 60 kbar, as
evidenced from pressure-dependent synchrotron powder diffraction data.
Temperature-dependent synchrotron powder diffraction data indicate an evolution
of the room-temperature BaFe2Se3 structure towards a high symmetry CsCu2Cl3
form upon heating. Around 425 K BaFe2Se3 undergoes a reversible, first order
isostructural transition, that is supported by the differential scanning
calorimetry data. The temperature-dependent structural changes occur in two
stages, as determined by the alignment of the FeSe4 tetrahedra and
corresponding adjustments of the positions of Ba atoms. On further heating, a
second order phase transformation into the Cmcm structure is observed at 660 K.
A rather unusual combination of isostructural and second-order phase
transformations is parameterized within phenomenological theory assuming

of two giant, linearly-polarized radio Lobes, containing three ridge-like

Our data signal that the radio Lobes originate in a bi-conical, star-formation

transports a massive magnetic energy of ~10^55 erg into the Galactic halo. The

phenomenon is expected on a longer time scale when the light of remote stars

observed at optical wavelengths. The aim of the study described in this paper
is to fully simulate the scintillation process, starting from the molecular
cloud description as a fractal object, ending with the simulations of
fluctuating stellar light curves. Fast Fourier transforms are first used to
simulate fractal clouds. Then, the illumination pattern resulting from the
crossing of background star light through these refractive clouds is calculated
from a Fresnel integral that also uses fast Fourier transform techniques.
Regularisation procedure and computing limitations are discussed, along with
the effect of spatial and temporal coherency (source size and wavelength
passband). We quantify the expected modulation index of stellar light curves as
a function of the turbulence strength --characterised by the diffraction radius
$R_{diff}$-- and the projected source size, introduce the timing aspects, and
establish connections between the light curve observables and the refractive
cloud. We extend our discussion to clouds with different structure functions
from Kolmogorov-type turbulence. Our study confirms that current telescopes of
~4m with fast-readout, wide-field detectors have the capability of discovering
the first interstellar optical scintillation effects. We also show that this

requirements in terms of readout speed and radiation tolerance, a CMOS process

exploited. In this respect, the charged particle detection performance and
radiation hardness of the TowerJazz 0.18 um CMOS process were studied with the
help of the first prototype chip MIMOSA 32. The beam tests performed with
negative pions of 120 GeV/c at the CERN-SPS allowed to measure a

occurs also naturally in stellar gases and planetary atmospheres. The
possibility of additional scattering-induced feedback (that is, random lasing)

Here, we report the experimental observation of random lasing in a controlled,

framework for smart energy management based on the concept of
quality-of-service in electricity (QoSE). Specifically, the resident
electricity demand is classified into basic usage and quality usage. The basic
usage is always guaranteed by the MG, while the quality usage is controlled
based on the MG state. The microgrid control center (MGCC) aims to minimize the
MG operation cost and maintain the outage probability of quality usage, i.e.,
QoSE, below a target value, by scheduling electricity among renewable energy
resources, energy storage systems, and macrogrid. The problem is formulated as
a constrained stochastic programming problem. The Lyapunov optimization
technique is then applied to derive an adaptive electricity scheduling
algorithm by introducing the QoSE virtual queues and energy storage virtual
queues. The proposed algorithm is an online algorithm since it does not require

galaxies with the highest [O III]/[O II] ratios and the best candidates for
escaping ionizing radiation. The Balmer line equivalent widths and He I
{\lambda}3819 emission in the extreme Peas support young ages of 3-5 Myr, and
He II {\lambda}4686 emission in five extreme Peas signals the presence of hard
ionizing sources. Ionization by active galactic nuclei or high-mass X-ray
binaries is inconsistent with the Peas' line ratios and ages. Although stacked
spectra reveal no Wolf-Rayet (WR) features, we tentatively detect WR features
in the SDSS spectra of three extreme Peas. Based on the Peas' ages and line
ratios, we find that WR stars, chemically homogeneous O stars, or shocks could
produce the observed He II emission. If hot stars are responsible, the Peas'
optical depths are ambiguous. However, accounting for emission from shocks
lowers the inferred optical depth and suggests that the Peas may be optically
thin. The Peas' ages likely optimize the escape of Lyman-continuum radiation;
they are old enough for supernovae and stellar winds to reshape the
interstellar medium, but young enough to possess large numbers of UV-luminous O
or WR stars.

failure, a precise Dirichlet prior distribution models epistemic uncertainty in
the alpha-factors. This Dirichlet prior is then updated with observed data to
obtain a posterior distribution, which forms the basis for further inferences.
  In this paper, we adapt the imprecise Dirichlet model of Walley to represent
epistemic uncertainty in the alpha-factors. In this approach, epistemic
uncertainty is expressed more cautiously via lower and upper expectations for
each alpha-factor, along with a learning parameter which determines how quickly
the model learns from observed data. For this application, we focus on
elicitation of the learning parameter, and find that values in the range of 1
to 10 seem reasonable. The approach is compared with Kelly and Atwood's
minimally informative Dirichlet prior for the alpha-factor model, which
incorporated precise mean values for the alpha-factors, but which was otherwise
quite diffuse.
  Next, we explore the use of a set of Gamma priors to model epistemic
uncertainty in the marginal failure rate, expressed via a lower and upper
expectation for this rate, again along with a learning parameter. As zero
counts are generally less of an issue here, we find that the choice of this
learning parameter is less crucial.
  Finally, we demonstrate how both epistemic uncertainty models can be combined
to arrive at lower and upper expectations for all common-cause failure rates.
Thereby, we effectively provide a full sensitivity analysis of common-cause
failure rates, properly reflecting epistemic uncertainty of the analyst on all
levels of the common-cause failure model.

flatter than the traditional Salpeter slope of 2.35. The age of the cluster is
between 2.5-5.8 Myr with 95% confidence, which is a younger age than typically
adopted but consistent within the uncertainties of past measurements. The exact
age of the cluster is difficult to determine since our results show two
distinct age solutions (3.9 Myr and 2.8 Myr) due to model degeneracies in the
relative number of Wolf-Rayet and OB stars. The total cluster mass is between
14,000 - 37,000 \msun above 1 \msun and it is necessary to include multiple
star systems in order to fit the observed luminosity function and the number of
observed Wolf-Rayet stars. The new IMF slope measurement is now consistent with
X-ray observations indicating a factor of 10 fewer X-ray emitting
pre-main-sequence stars than expected when compared with a Salpeter IMF. The
young cluster at the Galactic center is one of the few definitive examples of
an IMF that deviates significantly from the near-universal IMFs found in the

upon reaching a fixed separation (called the reaction-radius). The Doi model
uses reaction potentials, whereby two molecules react with a fixed probability
per unit time, $\lambda$, when separated by less than the reaction radius. In
this work we study the rigorous relationship between the two models. For the
special case of a protein diffusing to a fixed DNA binding site, we prove that
the solution to the Doi model converges to the solution of the Smoluchowski
model as $\lambda \to \infty$, with a rigorous $O(\lambda^{-1/2 + \epsilon})$
error bound (for any fixed $\epsilon > 0$). We investigate by numerical
simulation, for biologically relevant parameter values, the difference between
the solutions and associated reaction time statistics of the two models. As the
reaction-radius is decreased, for sufficiently large but fixed values of
$\lambda$, these differences are found to increase like the inverse of the
binding radius.

2 Gyr mainly occupy the stellar spheroid, with the oldest (earliest forming)
stars having more centrally concentrated profiles. The younger age cohorts
populate disks of progressively longer radial scale length and shorter vertical
scale height. At a given radius, the vertical density profiles and velocity
dispersions of stars vary smoothly as a function of age, and the superposition
of old, vertically-extended and young, vertically-compact cohorts gives rise to
a double-exponential profile like that observed in the MW. Turning to formation
history, we find that the trends of spatial structure and kinematics with
stellar age are largely imprinted at birth, or immediately thereafter. Stars
that form during the active merger phase at z>3 are quickly scattered into
rounded, kinematically hot configurations. The oldest disk cohorts form in
structures that are radially compact and relatively thick, while subsequent
cohorts form in progressively larger, thinner, colder configurations from gas
with increasing levels of rotational support. The disk thus forms ""inside-out""
in a radial sense and ""upside-down"" in a vertical sense. Secular heating and
radial migration influence the final state of each age cohort, but the changes
they produce are small compared to the trends established at formation. The
predicted correlations of stellar age with spatial and kinematic structure are
in good qualitative agreement with the correlations observed for mono-abundance
stellar populations in the MW.

[OIII] detections are from the two Lyman break galaxies embedded in the blob
halo. The [OIII] measurements were made with LUCIFER on the 8.4m Large
Binocular Telescope and NIRSPEC on 10m Keck Telescope. Comparing the redshift
of the [OIII] measurements to Lyman-alpha redshifts from SAURON (Weijmans et
al. 2010) allows us to take a step towards understanding the kinematics of the
gas in the blob. Using both LUCIFER and NIRSPEC we find velocity offsets
between the [OIII] and Lyman-alpha redshifts that are modestly negative or
consistent with 0 km/s in both subregions studied (ranging from -72 +/- 42 --
+6 +/- 33 km/s). A negative offset means Lyman-alpha is blueshifted with
respect to [OIII], a positive offset then implies Lyman-alpha is redshifted
with respect to [OIII]. These results may imply that outflows are not primarily
responsible for Lyman alpha escape in this LAB, since outflows are generally
expected to produce a positive velocity offset (McLinden et al. 2011). In
addition, we present an [OIII] line flux upper limit on a third region of LAB1,
a region that is unassociated with any underlying galaxy. We find that the

1.4 -- 2.5 times fainter than the [OIII] flux from one of the LBG-associated

that the baryon fraction in clusters agrees with the cosmic value
Omega_b/Omega_m, and does not differ from one system to another. We test this
hypothesis by measuring the gas mass fraction over the entire cluster volume in
a sample of local clusters. Combining the SZ thermal pressure from Planck and
the X-ray gas density from ROSAT, we measured for the first time the average
gas fraction (fgas) out to the virial radius and beyond in a large sample of
clusters. We also obtained azimuthally-averaged measurements of the gas
fraction for 18 individual systems, which we used to compute the scatter of
fgas around the mean value at different radii and its dependence on the
cluster's temperature. The gas mass fraction increases with radius and reaches
the cosmic baryon fraction close to R200. At R200, we measure
fgas,200=0.176+/-0.009. We find significant differences between the baryon
fraction of relaxed, cool-core (CC) systems and unrelaxed, non-cool core (NCC)
clusters in the outer regions. In average, the gas fraction in NCC clusters
slightly exceeds the cosmic baryon fraction, while in CC systems the gas
fraction converges to the expected value when accounting for the stellar
content, without any evidence for variations from one system to another. We
find that fgas estimates in NCC systems slightly disagree with the cosmic value
approaching R200. This result could be explained either by a violation of the
assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium or by an inhomogeneous distribution of
the gas mass. Conversely, cool-core clusters are found to provide reliable
constraints on fgas at overdensities >200, which makes them suitable for
cosmological studies.

spherically symmetric smooth galactic potential. The model clusters cover a
range of initial half-mass radii and orbital eccentricities in order to test
the historical assumption that the tidal radius of a cluster is imposed at
perigalacticon. The traditional assumption for globular clusters is that since
the internal relaxation time is larger than its orbital period, the cluster is
tidally stripped at perigalacticon. Instead, our simulations show that a
cluster with an eccentric orbit does not need to fully relax in order to
expand. After a perigalactic pass, a cluster re-captures previously unbound
stars, and the tidal shock at perigalacticon has the effect of energizing inner
region stars to larger orbits. Therefore, instead of the limiting radius being
imposed at perigalacticon, it more nearly traces the instantaneous tidal radius
of the cluster at any point in the orbit. We present a numerical correction
factor to theoretical tidal radii calculated at perigalacticon which takes into
consideration both the orbital eccentricity and current orbital phase of the
cluster.

the gas and star formation rate (SFR) surface densities of ensembles of clumps
composing galaxies at this redshift, even though the corresponding scales are
not resolved. This method is based on identifying these structures in
position-velocity diagrams corresponding to slices within the galaxies. We use
unique IRAM observations of the CO(3-2) rotational line and DEEP2 spectra of
four massive star forming distant galaxies - EGS13003805, EGS13004291,
EGS12007881, and EGS13019128 in the AEGIS terminology - to determine the gas
and SFR surface densities of the identifiable ensembles of clumps that
constitute them. The integrated CO line luminosity is assumed to be directly
proportional to the total gas mass, and the SFR is deduced from the [OII] line.
We identify the ensembles of clumps with the angular resolution available in
both CO and [OII] spectroscopy; i.e., 1-1.5"". SFR and gas surface densities are
averaged in areas of this size, which is also the thickness of the DEEP2 slits

within the typical SGRB progenitor model is challenging as late time accretion,
often used to explain plateaus in LGRBs, is likely to be absent from the SGRB
population. Alternatively, it is predicted that the remnant of NS-NS mergers
may not collapse immediately to a BH (or even collapse at all), forming instead
an unstable millisecond pulsar (magnetar) which powers a plateau phase in the
X-ray lightcurve. By fitting the magnetar model to all of the Swift SGRBs
observed until May 2012, we find that about half can be clearly fitted with a
magnetar plateau phase while the rest are consistent with forming a magnetar
but the data are insufficient to prove a plateau phase. More data, both at
early times and a larger sample, are required to confirm this. This model can

only, we compute the color of the red pigment cerium fluorosulfide CeSF, as
well as of mercury sulfide HgS (classic ""vermilion""). Our methodology employs
many-body theories to compute the optical absorption, combined with an
intermediate length-scale modelization to assess how coloration depends on film
thickness, pigment concentration and granularity. We introduce a quantitative
criterion for the performance of a pigment. While for HgS this criterion is
satisfied due to large transition matrix elements between wide bands, CeSF
presents an alternative paradigm: the bright red color is shown to stem from
the combined effect of the quasi two-dimensionality and the localized nature of
4f-states. Our work demonstrates the power of modern computational methods,
with implications for the theoretical design of materials with specific optical
properties.

formation rate galaxies at higher redshifts, it is becoming increasingly
important to understand the conditions of the gas in these systems to properly
infer their molecular gas content. The rotational transitions of the carbon
monoxide (CO) molecule provide an excellent probe of the gas excitation
conditions in these galaxies. In this paper we present the results from the gas
excitation sample of the Evolution of molecular Gas in Normal Galaxies (EGNoG)
survey at the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA).
This subset of the full EGNoG sample consists of four galaxies at z~0.3 with
star formation rates of 40-65 M_Sun yr^-1 and stellar masses of ~2x10^11 M_Sun.
Using the 3 mm and 1 mm bands at CARMA, we observe both the CO(1-0) and CO(3-2)
transitions in these four galaxies in order to probe the excitation of the
molecular gas. We report robust detections of both lines in three galaxies (and
an upper limit on the fourth), with an average line ratio, r_31 = L'_CO(3-2) /
L'_CO(1-0), of 0.46 \pm 0.07 (with systematic errors \lesssim 40%), which
implies sub-thermal excitation of the CO(3-2) line. We conclude that the
excitation of the gas in these massive, highly star-forming galaxies is
consistent with normal star-forming galaxies such as local spirals, not
starbursting systems like local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. Since the
EGNoG gas excitation sample galaxies are selected from the main sequence of
star-forming galaxies, we suggest that this result is applicable to studies of
main sequence galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts, supporting the
assumptions made in studies that find molecular gas fractions in star forming
galaxies at z~1-2 to be an order of magnitude larger than what is observed
locally.

been designed to surpass existing arrays in terms of sensitivity, angular
resolution and frequency coverage. This evolution has led to the development of
advanced calibration techniques that ensure the delivery of accurate results at
the lowest possible computational cost. However, the performance of such
calibration techniques is still limited by the compact, bright sources in the
sky, used as calibrators. It is important to have a bright enough source that
is well distinguished from the background noise level in order to achieve
satisfactory results in calibration. We present ""clustered calibration"" as a
modification to traditional radio interferometric calibration, in order to
accommodate faint sources that are almost below the background noise level into
the calibration process. The main idea is to employ the information of the
bright sources' measured signals as an aid to calibrate fainter sources that
are nearby the bright sources. In the case where we do not have bright enough
sources, a source cluster could act as a bright source that can be
distinguished from background noise. We construct a number of source clusters
assuming that the signals of the sources belonging to a single cluster are
corrupted by almost the same errors, and each cluster is calibrated as a single
source, using the combined coherencies of its sources simultaneously. This
upgrades the power of an individual faint source by the effective power of its
cluster. We give performance analysis of clustered calibration to show the
superiority of this approach compared to the traditional unclustered
calibration. We also provide analytical criteria to choose the optimum number
of clusters for a given observation in an efficient manner.

  Notices",,"10.1093/mnras/stt385",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that direct detection and measurement of the vertically thickened
parts of bars (so-called ""boxy"" or ""peanut-shaped"" bulges) is possible not only
for edge-on galaxies but also for galaxies with moderate inclinations (i < 70
deg), and that examples are relatively common in the nearby universe.
  Analysis of a sample of 78 nearby, moderately inclined (i < 65 deg)
early-type (S0--Sb) barred galaxies shows that the isophotal signature of the
box/peanut can usually be detected for inclinations as low as i ~ 40 deg -- and
in exceptional cases down to i ~ 30 deg. In agreement with the predictions from
N-body simulations, the signature is most easily detectable when the bar's
position angle is within ~ 50 deg of the galaxy major axis; in particular,
galaxies where the bar lies very close to the minor axis do not show the
signature clearly or at all. For galaxies with i = 40--65 deg and relative
angles < 45 deg, we find evidence for the signature ~ 2/3 of the time; the true
frequency of box/peanut structures in bars may be higher.
  Comparison with N-body models also allows us to link observed photometric
morphology with 3D physical structures, and thus estimate the relative sizes of
box/peanut structures and bars. For our local sample, we find that box/peanut
structures range in radial size (measured along the bar major axis) from
0.4--3.8 kpc (mean = 1.5 +/- 0.9 kpc) and span 0.26--0.58 of the bar length
(mean of 0.38 +/- 0.08). This is a clear observational confirmation that when
bars thicken, it is not the entire bar which does so, but only the inner part.
  This technique can also be used to identify galaxies with bars which have not
vertically thickened. We suggest that NGC 3049 and IC 676 may be particularly
good examples, and that the fraction of S0--Sb bars which lack box/peanut
structures is at least ~ 13%.

type of variability is possibly connected with the accretion of matter through
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability that occurs at the interface between an
accretion disc and a stellar magnetosphere. In this regime, matter accretes in
several temporarily formed accretion streams or `tongues' which appear in
random locations, and produce stochastic photometric and line variability. We
use the results of global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
matter flows in both stable and unstable accretion regimes to calculate
time-dependent hydrogen line profiles and study their variability behaviours.
In the stable regime, some hydrogen lines (e.g. H-beta, H-gamma, H-delta,
Pa-beta and Br-gamma) show a redshifted absorption component only during a
fraction of a stellar rotation period, and its occurrence is periodic. However,
in the unstable regime, the redshifted absorption component is present rather
persistently during a whole stellar rotation cycle, and its strength varies
non-periodically. In the stable regime, an ordered accretion funnel stream
passes across the line of sight to an observer only once per stellar rotation
period while in the unstable regime, several accreting streams/tongues, which
are formed randomly, pass across the line of sight to an observer. The latter
results in the quasi-stationarity appearance of the redshifted absorption
despite the strongly unstable nature of the accretion. In the unstable regime,
multiple hot spots form on the surface of the star, producing the stochastic
light curve with several peaks per rotation period. This study suggests a CTTS
that exhibits a stochastic light curve and a stochastic line variability, with
a rather persistent redshifted absorption component, may be accreting in the
unstable accretion regime.

this ""MgII problem"" and present a detailed explanation of the statistical tools
required to assess the significance of the discrepancy. We find the problem
exists at the 4{\sigma} level for GRBs with high-resolution spectra. It has
been suggested that the discrepancy can be resolved by the combination of a
dust obscuration bias towards QSOs, and a strong gravitational lensing bias
towards GRBs. We investigate one of the two most probable lensed GRBs that we
presented in our previous work (GRB020405; Rapoport et al.) and find it not to
be strongly gravitationally lensed, constraining the percentage of lensed GRBs
to be < 35% (2{\sigma}). Dust obscuration of QSOs has been estimated to be a
significant effect with dusty MgII systems removing ~20% of absorbed objects
from flux-limited QSO samples. We find that if ~30% of the strong MgII systems
towards QSOs are missing from the observed samples, then GRBs and QSOs would
have comparable numbers of absorbers per unit redshift. Thus, gravitational
lensing bias is likely to make only a modest contribution to solving the MgII
problem. However, if the dust obscuration bias has been slightly
underestimated, the MgII problem would no longer persist.

distance-regular graphs and the modules for the anticommutator spin algebra.
Let $\K$ denote an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Let $V$
denote a vector space over $\K$ with finite positive dimension. A Leonard
triple on $V$ is an ordered triple of linear transformations in
$\mathrm{End}(V)$ such that for each of these transformations there exists a
basis for $V$ with respect to which the matrix representing that transformation
is diagonal and the matrices representing the other two transformations are
irreducible tridiagonal. The Leonard triples of interest to us are said to be
totally B/AB and of Bannai/Ito type.
  Totally B/AB Leonard triples of Bannai/Ito type arise in conjunction with the
anticommutator spin algebra $\mathcal{A}$, the unital associative $\K$-algebra
defined by generators $x,y,z$ and relations\[xy+yx=2z,\qquad yz+zy=2x,\qquad
zx+xz=2y.\]
  Let $D\geq0$ denote an integer, let $Q_{D}$ denote the hypercube of diameter
$D$ and let $\tilde{Q}_{D}$ denote the antipodal quotient. Let $T$ (resp.
$\tilde{T}$) denote the Terwilliger algebra for $Q_{D}$ (resp.
$\tilde{Q}_{D}$).
  We obtain the following. When $D$ is even (resp. odd), we show that there
exists a unique $\mathcal{A}$-module structure on $Q_{D}$ (resp.
$\tilde{Q}_{D}$) such that $x,y$ act as the adjacency and dual adjacency
matrices respectively. We classify the resulting irreducible
$\mathcal{A}$-modules up to isomorphism. We introduce weighted adjacency
matrices for $Q_{D}$, $\tilde{Q}_{D}$. When $D$ is even (resp. odd) we show
that actions of the adjacency, dual adjacency and weighted adjacency matrices
for $Q_{D}$ (resp. $\tilde{Q}_{D}$) on any irreducible $T$-module (resp.

can escape promptly into the heliosphere, on time scales of an hour or less.
Impulsive solar energetic particles (SEP) bursts are generally observed in
association with so-called eruptive flares consisting of a coronal mass
ejection (CME) and a flare. These highly prompt SEPs are believed to be
accelerated directly by the flare, rather than by the CME shock, although the
precise mechanism by which the particles are accelerated remains controversial.
Whatever their origin, within the magnetic geometry of the standard
eruptive-flare model, the accelerated particles should remain trapped in the
closed magnetic fields of the coronal flare loops and the ejected flux rope. In
this case the particles would reach the Earth only after a delay of many hours
to a few days, when the bulk ejecta arrive at Earth. We propose that the
external magnetic reconnection intrinsic to the breakout model for CME
initiation can naturally account for the prompt escape of flare-accelerated
energetic particles onto open interplanetary magnetic flux tubes. We present
detailed 2.5D MHD simulations of a breakout CME/flare event with a background
isothermal solar wind. Our calculations demonstrate that if the event occurs
sufficiently near a coronal-hole boundary, interchange reconnection between
open and closed field can occur, which allows particles from deep inside the
ejected flux rope to access solar wind field lines soon after eruption. We
compare these results with the standard observations of impulsive SEPs and
discuss the implications of the model for further observations and
calculations.

negative energy density so it is always possible that at some early phase of

density of the universe became very small making the effective Hubble radius
very big. This possibility gives rise to the probability of a bouncing
universe. As will be shown in the article that a simple Lee-Wick radiation is
not enough to produce a bounce. There can be two possibilities which can
produce a bounce in the Lee-Wick radiation phase. One requires a cold dark
matter candidate to trigger the bounce and the other possibility requires the
bouncing temperature to be fine tuned such as all the Lee-Wick partners of the
standard fields are not thermalized at the bounce temperature. Both the
possibilities give rise to blue-tilted power spectrum of metric perturbations.
Moreover the bouncing universe model can predict the lower limit of the masses
of the Lee-Wick partners of chiral fermions and massless gauge bosons. The mass
limit intrinsically depends upon the bounce temperature.

aperture losses and increased spectral resolution. Sixteen optical fibres
collect light from a 5.0 arcsecond^2 area of sky and reformat it into the
equivalent of a 0.6 arcsecond wide slit, delivering a spectral resolution of R
= 70000 and up to twice as much flux as the standard 1 arcsecond slit of the

calibration via a dedicated fibre. CYCLOPS2 consists of three main components,
the fore-optics unit, fibre bundle and slit unit. The fore optics unit
incorporates magnification optics and a lenslet array and is designed to mount
to the CURE Cassegrain instrument interface, which provides acquisition,
guiding and calibration facilities. The fibre bundle transports the light from
the Cassegrain focus to the UCLES spectrograph at Coud\'e and also includes a
fibre mode scrambler. The slit unit consists of the fibre slit and relay optics
to project an image of the slit onto the entrance aperture of the UCLES

The scheme is robust against deviations in the pulse delay and laser intensity
through some simple analysis of the adiabatic condition. It is notable that the
estimated range of the effective adiabaticity condition coincides with the
numerical results. When taking dissipation into account, we show that the
process is immune to atomic spontaneous emission as the atomic excited states
are never populated in adiabatic evolution. Moreover, under certain conditions,
the cavity decay can also be efficiently suppressed.

Field-Effect-Transistor (SymFET) is presented. The current in a SymFET flows by
tunneling from an n-type graphene layer to a p-type graphene layer. A large
current peak occurs when the Dirac points are aligned at a particular drain-to-
source bias VDS . Our model shows that the current of the SymFET is very weakly
dependent on temperature. The resonant current peak is controlled by chemical
doping and applied gate bias. The on/off ratio increases with graphene
coherence length and doping. The symmetric resonant peak is a good candidate
for high-speed analog applications, and can enable digital logic similar to the
BiSFET. Our analytical model also offers the benefit of permitting simple
analysis of features such as the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the
resonant peak and higher order harmonics of the nonlinear current. The SymFET
takes advantage of the perfect symmetry of the bandstructure of 2D graphene, a
feature that is not present in conventional semiconductors.

bright sky background seen by near infrared spectrographs. By filtering out the
airglow emission lines at high resolution before the light enters the
spectrograph this technique prevents scattering from the emission lines into
interline regions, thereby reducing the background at all wavelengths. In order
to take full advantage of this sky background reduction the spectrograph must
have very low instrumental backgrounds so that it remains sky noise limited.
Both simulations and real world experience with the prototype GNOSIS system
show that existing spectrographs, designed for higher sky background levels,
will be unable to fully exploit the sky background reduction. We therefore
propose PRAXIS, a spectrograph optimised specifically for this purpose. The
PRAXIS concept is a fibre fed, fully cryogenic, fixed format spectrograph for
the J and H-bands. Dark current will be minimised by using the best of the
latest generation of NIR detectors while thermal backgrounds will be reduced by
the use of a cryogenic fibre slit. Optimised spectral formats and the use of
high throughput volume phase holographic gratings will further enhance
sensitivity. Our proposal is for a modular system, incorporating exchangeable
fore-optics units, integral field units and OH suppression units, to allow
PRAXIS to operate as a visitor instrument on any large telescope and enable new
developments in FBG OH suppression to be incorporated as they become available.
As a high performance fibre fed spectrograph PRAXIS could also serve as a
testbed for other astrophotonic technologies.

  University, India on January 10, 2013",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of this presentation is to build an efficient non-parametric Bayes
classifier in the presence of large numbers of predictors. When analyzing such
data, parametric models are often too inflexible while non-parametric
procedures tend to be non-robust because of insufficient data on these high
dimensional spaces. When dealing with these types of data, it is often the case
that most of the variability tends to lie along a few directions, or more
generally along a much smaller dimensional subspace of the feature space. Hence
a class of regression models is proposed that flexibly learn about this
subspace while simultaneously performing dimension reduction in classification.
This methodology, allows the cell probabilities to vary non-parametrically
based on a few coordinates expressed as linear combinations of the predictors.
Also, as opposed to many black-box methods for dimensionality reduction, the
proposed model is appealing in having clearly interpretable and identifiable
parameters which provide insight into which predictors are important in
determining accurate classification boundaries. Gibbs sampling methods are
developed for posterior computations. The estimated cell probabilities are
theoretically shown to be consistent, and real data applications are included
to support the findings.

obstruction for hyperelliptic curves of arbitrary genus whose reduced

  The obstruction is described by the so-called arithmetic dihedral invariants

also allows the explicit determination of a model over the field of moduli; if
not, then one obtains a hyperelliptic model over a degree 2 extension of this

states of the atomic ensemble, and later a reversal of the applied field leads
to a rephasing of the atomic polarization and a reemission of the light. As
opposed to previous proposals for CRIB based quantum memories we propose to
only apply the broadening for a short period after most of the pulse has
already been absorbed by the ensemble. We show that with this procedure there
exist certain modes of the incoming light field which can be stored with an
efficiency approaching 100% in the limit of high optical depth and long
coherence time of the atoms. These results demonstrate that it is possible to
operate an efficient quantum memory without any optical control fields.

adding a penalty associated with failure to follow a winning strategy.
  The Seel & Strack model consists of $n$-agents each of whom privately
observes a transient diffusion process and chooses when to stop it. The player
with the highest stopped value wins the contest, and each player's objective is
to maximise their probability of winning the contest. We give a new derivation
of the results of Seel & Strack based on a Lagrangian approach. Moreover, we
consider an extension of the problem in which in the case when an agent is
penalised when their strategy is suboptimal, in the sense that they do not win
the contest, but there existed an alternative strategy which would have
resulted in victory.

lexica. Given an input string (the pattern) and a similarity threshold, the

partial match where a substring of the input pattern is aligned with a
substring of a lexicon word. Afterwards this partial match is extended stepwise
to larger substrings. For aligning further parts of the pattern with
corresponding parts of lexicon entries, more errors are tolerated at each
subsequent step. For supporting this alignment order, which may start at any
part of the pattern, the lexicon is represented as a structure that enables
immediate access to any substring of a lexicon word and permits the extension
of such substrings in both directions. Experimental evaluations of the
approximate search procedure are given that show significant efficiency
improvements compared to existing techniques. Since the technique can be used

the Sum-over-Forests (SoF) density index. It is based on a clear and intuitive
idea: high-density regions in a graph are characterized by the fact that they
contain a large amount of low-cost trees with high outdegrees while low-density
regions contain few ones. Therefore, a Boltzmann probability distribution on
the countable set of forests in the graph is defined so that large (high-cost)
forests occur with a low probability while short (low-cost) forests occur with
a high probability. Then, the SoF density index of a node is defined as the
expected outdegree of this node in a non-trivial tree of the forest, thus
providing a measure of density around that node. Following the matrix-forest
theorem, and a statistical physics framework, it is shown that the SoF density
index can be easily computed in closed form through a simple matrix inversion.
Experiments on artificial and real data sets show that the proposed index
performs well on finding dense regions, for graphs of various origins.

the one hand graphene, where the charge carriers obey the linear dispersion

materials where the effective electron mass approaches the mass of a proton.
Here we show that both extremes, Dirac fermions like they are found in graphene

only coexist in a solid but can undergo strong mutual interactions. Using the
example of EuRh2Si2 we explicitly demonstrate that these interactions can take
place at the surface and in the bulk. The presence of the linear dispersion is
imposed solely by the crystal symmetry while the existence of heavy

the extremes of so-called physical observables are distributed according to the
classical generalised Pareto distribution and derive explicit expressions for
the scaling and the shape parameter. In particular, we derive that the shape
parameter does not depend on the chosen observables, but only on the partial
dimensions of the invariant measure on the stable, unstable, and neutral
manifolds. The shape parameter is negative and is close to zero when
high-dimensional systems are considered. This result agrees with what was
derived recently using the generalized extreme value approach. Combining the
results obtained using such physical observables and the properties of the
extremes of distance observables, it is possible to derive estimates of the
partial dimensions of the attractor along the stable and the unstable
directions of the flow. Moreover, by writing the shape parameter in terms of
moments of the extremes of the considered observable and by using linear
response theory, we relate the sensitivity to perturbations of the shape
parameter to the sensitivity of the moments, of the partial dimensions, and of
the Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the attractor. Preliminary numerical
investigations provide encouraging results on the applicability of the theory
presented here. The results presented here do not apply for all combinations of
Axiom A systems and observables, but the breakdown seems to be related to very
special geometrical configurations.

field. We compare the magnetic configuration with the UV observations and
identify the magnetic structures expected to be involved in the event. Using an
3D MHD simulation of interchange reconnection, we showed that the evolution of
the UV structures follows the magnetic field dynamics and the UV emitting
structures have a pattern very similar to the plasma emission derived from the
simulation. Our results highlight that the exchange between open and closed in
the pseudo-streamer topology related to an observed event occurs at least
partially at the null-point, similarly to the interchange reconnection in a
single null-point topology. However, our results also indicate that the
interchange reconnection in pseudo-streamers is a gradual physical process
which opposes to the impulsive reconnection of the solar-jet model.

objective is to open $k$ nodes as centers such that the maximum distance from
any vertex to its closest center is minimized. In this paper, we consider two
important generalizations of $k$-center, the matroid center problem and the
knapsack center problem. Both problems are motivated by recent content
distribution network applications. Our contributions can be summarized as
follows:
  1. We consider the matroid center problem in which the centers are required
to form an independent set of a given matroid. We show this problem is NP-hard
even on a line. We present a 3-approximation algorithm for the problem on
general metrics. We also consider the outlier version of the problem where a
given number of vertices can be excluded as the outliers from the solution. We
present a 7-approximation for the outlier version.
  2. We consider the (multi-)knapsack center problem in which the centers are
required to satisfy one (or more) knapsack constraint(s). It is known that the
knapsack center problem with a single knapsack constraint admits a
3-approximation. However, when there are at least two knapsack constraints, we
show this problem is not approximable at all. To complement the hardness
result, we present a polynomial time algorithm that gives a 3-approximate
solution such that one knapsack constraint is satisfied and the others may be
violated by at most a factor of $1+\epsilon$. We also obtain a 3-approximation
for the outlier version that may violate the knapsack constraint by
$1+\epsilon$.

matrix-symmetry properties such as persymmetry. Furthermore, the systems may
exhibit physical symmetries translating into symmetry properties of the
eigenvectors of interest. Both types of symmetry can be exploited in sparse
representation formats such as Matrix Product States (MPS) for the desired
eigenvectors.
  This paper summarizes symmetries of Hamiltonians for typical physical systems
such as the Ising model and lists resulting properties of the related
eigenvectors. Based on an overview of Matrix Product States (Tensor Trains or
Tensor Chains) and their canonical normal forms we show how symmetry properties
of the vector translate into relations between the MPS matrices and, in turn,
which symmetry properties result from relations within the MPS matrices. In
this context we analyze different kinds of symmetries and derive appropriate
normal forms for MPS representing these symmetries. Exploiting such symmetries
by using these normal forms will lead to a reduction in the number of degrees
of freedom in the MPS matrices. This paper provides a uniform platform for both
well-known and new results which are presented from the (multi-)linear algebra

'ambiguity' has been introduced which depends on the existence of a
Kolmogorovian probabilistic structure modeling these uncertainties. On the
other hand, evidence of everyday life suggests that context plays a fundamental
role in human decisions under uncertainty. Moreover, it is well known from
physics that any probabilistic structure modeling contextual interactions
between entities structurally needs a non-Kolmogorovian framework admitting a
quantum-like representation. For this reason, we have recently introduced a
notion of 'contextual risk' to mathematically capture situations in which
ambiguity occurs. We prove in this paper that the contextual risk approach can
be applied to the Ellsberg paradox, and elaborate a sphere model within our
'hidden measurement formalism' which reveals that it is the overall conceptual
landscape that is responsible of the disagreement between actual human
decisions and the predictions of expected utility theory, which generates the
paradox. This result points to the presence of a quantum conceptual layer' in

fluid-particle flows with a two-way coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) for the fluid and the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for the solid phase.
The unresolved fluid model, based on the locally averaged Navier Stokes
equations, is expected to be considerably faster than fully resolved models.
Furthermore, in contrast to similar mesh-based Discrete Particle Methods
(DPMs), our purely particle-based method enjoys the flexibility that comes from
the lack of a prescribed mesh. It is suitable for problems such as free surface
flow or flow around complex, moving and/or intermeshed geometries and is
applicable to both dilute and dense particle flows.
  Second, a comprehensive validation procedure for fluid-particle simulations
is presented and applied here to the SPH-DEM method, using simulations of
single and multiple particle sedimentation in a 3D fluid column and comparison
with analytical models. Millimetre-sized particles are used along with three
different test fluids: air, water and a water-glycerol solution. The velocity
evolution for a single particle compares well (less than 1% error) with the
analytical solution as long as the fluid resolution is coarser than two times
the particle diameter. Two more complex multiple particle sedimentation
problems (sedimentation of a homogeneous porous block and an inhomogeneous
Rayleigh Taylor instability) are also reproduced well for porosities 0.6 <=
\epsilon <= 1.0, although care should be taken in the presence of high porosity
gradients.
  Overall the SPH-DEM method successfully reproduces quantitatively the
expected behaviour in the test cases, and promises to be a flexible and
accurate tool for other, realistic fluid-particle system simulations.

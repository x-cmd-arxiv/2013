miscible phases---one of which contains dissolved lipids---are mixed together
leading to the self-assembly of lipid molecules to form liposomes. This method
has been suggested, among other applications, for in-situ synthesis of
liposomes as drug delivery capsules. However, the mechanism that leads to a
specific size selection of the liposomes in solution based self-assembly in
general, and in flow-focussing microfluidic devices in particular, has so far
not been established. Here we report two aspects of this problem. A simple and
easily fabricated device for synthesis of monodisperse unilamellar liposomes in
a co-axial flow-focussing microfluidic geometry is presented. We also show that
the size of liposomes is dependent on the extent of micro-convective mixing of
the two miscible phases. Here, a viscosity stratification induced hydrodynamic
instability leads to a gentle micro-mixing which results in larger liposome
size than when the streams are mixed turbulently. The results are in sharp
contrast to a purely diffusive mixing in macroscopic laminar flow that was
believed to occur under these conditions. Further precise quantification of the
mixing characteristics should provide the insights to develop a general theory
for size selection for the class of ethanol injection methods. This will also
lay grounds for obtaining empirical evidence that will enable better control of
liposome sizes and for designing drug encapsulation and delivery devices.

components. The typical approach is to use the posterior distribution on the
number of components occurring so far --- that is, the posterior on the number
of clusters in the observed data. However, it turns out that this posterior is
not consistent --- it does not converge to the true number of components. In
this note, we give an elementary demonstration of this inconsistency in what is
perhaps the simplest possible setting: a DPM with normal components of unit
variance, applied to data from a ""mixture"" with one standard normal component.
Further, we find that this example exhibits severe inconsistency: instead of
going to 1, the posterior probability that there is one cluster goes to 0.

the moon looks larger near the horizon than near the zenith. In our model of
the moon illusion, the sky is considered a spatially-contiguous and
geometrically-smooth surface. When an object such as the moon breaks the
contiguity of the surface, instead of perceiving the object as appearing
through a hole in the surface, humans perceive an occlusion of the surface.
Binocular vision dictates that the moon is distant, but this perception model
contradicts our binocular vision, dictating that the moon is closer than the
sky. To resolve the contradiction, the brain distorts the projections of the
moon to increase the binocular disparity, which results in an increase in the
perceived size of the moon. The degree of distortion depends upon the apparent
distance to the sky, which is influenced by the surrounding objects and the
condition of the sky. As the apparent distance to the sky decreases, the
illusion becomes stronger. At the horizon, apparent distance to the sky is
minimal, whereas at the zenith, few distance cues are present, causing
difficulty with distance estimation and weakening the illusion.

and third known pulsars in the class of Central Compact Objects (CCOs) in
supernova remnants, proving that these young neutron stars have exceptionally
weak dipole magnetic field components. For the 112 ms PSR J0821-4300 in Puppis
A, Pdot = (9.28 +/- 0.36)E-18. Its proper motion, mu = 61 +/- 9 mas/yr, was
also measured using Chandra. This contributes a kinematic term to the period
derivative via the Shklovskii effect, which is subtracted from Pdot to derive
dipole Bs = 2.9E10 G, a value similar to that of first measured CCO PSR
J1852+0040 in Kes 79, which has Bs = 3.1E10 G. Antipodal surface hot spots with
different temperatures and areas are deduced from the X-ray spectrum and pulse
profiles. Paradoxically, such nonuniform surface temperature appears to require
strong crustal magnetic fields, probably toroidal or quadrupolar components
much stronger than the external dipole. A spectral feature, consisting of
either an emission line at approximately 0.75 keV or absorption at
approximately 0.46 keV, is modulated in strength with the rotation. It may be
due to a cyclotron process in a magnetic field on the surface that is slightly
stronger than the dipole deduced from the spin-down. We also timed anew the 424
ms PSR J12010-5226, resolving previous ambiguities about its spin-down rate.
Its Pdot = (2.22 +/- 0.02)E-17, corresponding to Bs = 9.8E10 G. This is
compatible with a cyclotron resonance interpretation of its prominent
absorption line at 0.7 keV and harmonics. These results deepen the mystery of
the origin and evolution of CCOs: why are their numerous descendants not
evident?

matching, photometric gain-matching, and pixel-outlier rejection. Co-addition
and/or HiRes'ing can be performed in either the inertial WCS, or in the rest
frame of a moving object. Three interpolation methods are supported:
overlap-area weighting, drizzle, and weighting by the detector Point Response
Function (PRF). The latter enables the creation of matched-filtered products
for optimal point-source detection, but most importantly allows for resolution
enhancement using a spatially-dependent deconvolution method. This is a variant
of the classic Richardson-Lucy algorithm with the added benefit to
simultaneously register and co-add multiple images to optimize signal-to-noise
and sampling of the instrumental PSF. It can assume real (or otherwise ""flat"")
image priors, mitigate ""ringing"" artifacts, and assess the quality of image
solutions using statistically-motivated convergence criteria. Uncertainties are
also estimated and internally validated for all products. The software supports
multithreading that can be configured for different architectures. Numerous

that hybridizes with a conduction band whose density of states vanishes in
power-law fashion at the Fermi energy, and couples, via its charge, to a
nondispersive bosonic mode (e.g., an optical phonon). The model, which we treat
using poor-man's scaling and the numerical renormalization group, exhibits
quantum phase transitions of different types depending on the strength of the
impurity-boson coupling. For weak impurity-boson coupling, the suppression of
the density of states near the Fermi energy leads to quantum phase transitions
between strong-coupling (Kondo) and local-moment phases. For sufficiently
strong impurity-boson coupling, however, the bare repulsion between a pair of
electrons in the impurity level becomes an effective attraction, leading to
quantum phase transitions between strong-coupling (charge-Kondo) and
local-charge phases. Even though the Hamiltonian exhibits different symmetries
in the spin and charge sectors, the thermodynamic properties near the two types
of quantum phase transition are closely related under spin-charge interchange.
Moreover, the critical responses to a local magnetic field (for small
impurity-boson coupling) and to an electric potential (for large impurity-boson
coupling) are characterized by the same exponents, whose values place these
quantum critical points in the universality class of the pseudogap Anderson
model. One specific case of the pseudogap Anderson-Holstein model may be
realized in a double-quantum-dot device, where the quantum phase transitions
manifest themselves in the finite-temperature linear electrical conductance.

key technologies for enabling multi-gigabit wireless access. However, the high
propagation loss in such a band poses major obstacles to the optimal
utilization of the wireless resources, where the problem of efficient client
association to access points (APs) is of vital importance. In this paper, the
client association in 60 GHz wireless access networks is investigated. The AP
utilization and the quality of the rapidly vanishing communication links are
the control parameters. Because of the tricky non-convex and combinatorial
nature of the client association optimization problem, a novel solution method
is developed to guarantee balanced and fair resource allocation. A new
distributed, lightweight and easy to implement association algorithm, based on
Lagrangian duality theory and subgradient methods, was proposed. It is shown
that the algorithm is asymptotically optimal, that is, the relative duality gap
diminishes to zero as the number of clients increases. Both theoretical and
numerical results evince numerous useful properties of the algorithm, such as
fast convergence, scalability, time efficiency, and fair execution in
comparison to existing approaches. It is concluded that the proposed solution

When the model under consideration is over a latent Gaussian field, with the

systematically be corrected. A perturbative expansion is made of the exact but
intractable correction, and can be applied to the model's partition function
and other moments of interest. The correction is expressed over the
higher-order cumulants which are neglected by EP's local matching of moments.
Through the expansion, we see that EP is correct to first order. By considering
higher orders, corrections of increasing polynomial complexity can be applied
to the approximation. The second order provides a correction in quadratic time,
which we apply to an array of Gaussian process and Ising models. The
corrections generalize to arbitrarily complex approximating families, which we
illustrate on tree-structured Ising model approximations. Furthermore, they
provide a polynomial-time assessment of the approximation error. We also
provide both theoretical and practical insights on the exactness of the EP

to treat, and as we demonstrate, the problem is particularly pronounced in
high-dimensional settings where the primary goal is {\em support recovery} of
the sparse regressor. We develop algorithms for support recovery in sparse
regression, when some number $n_1$ out of $n+n_1$ total covariate/response
pairs are {\it arbitrarily (possibly maliciously) corrupted}. We are interested
in understanding how many outliers, $n_1$, we can tolerate, while identifying
the correct support. To the best of our knowledge, neither standard outlier
rejection techniques, nor recently developed robust regression algorithms (that
focus only on corrupted response variables), nor recent algorithms for dealing
with stochastic noise or erasures, can provide guarantees on support recovery.
Perhaps surprisingly, we also show that the natural brute force algorithm that
searches over all subsets of $n$ covariate/response pairs, and all subsets of
possible support coordinates in order to minimize regression error, is
remarkably poor, unable to correctly identify the support with even $n_1 =
O(n/k)$ corrupted points, where $k$ is the sparsity. This is true even in the
basic setting we consider, where all authentic measurements and noise are
independent and sub-Gaussian. In this setting, we provide a simple algorithm --
no more computationally taxing than OMP -- that gives stronger performance
guarantees, recovering the support with up to $n_1 = O(n/(\sqrt{k} \log p))$

flux tube is affected by a global cutoff frequency that separates propagating
and non-propagating waves. In this paper, wave propagation along a thin but
non-isothermal flux tube is considered and a local cutoff frequency is derived.
The effects of different temperature profiles on this local cutoff frequency
are studied by considering different power-law temperature distributions as
well as the semi-empirical VAL C model of the solar atmosphere. The results
show that the conditions for wave propagation strongly depend on the
temperature gradients. Moreover, the local cutoff frequency calculated for the
VAL C model gives constraints on the range of wave frequencies that are
propagating in different parts of the solar atmosphere. These theoretically
predicted constraints are compared to observational data and are used to
discuss the role played by transverse tube waves in the atmospheric heating and
dynamics, and in the excitation of solar atmospheric oscillations.

study the behavior of dark energy at early times by taking into account the
severe bounds found at recombination era and/or at big bang nucleosynthesis.
The inclusion of a non interacting baryonic matter forces that the amount of
dark energy at $z_{t} \sim {\cal O}(1)$ changes abruptly implying that
$\Omega_x (z\simeq 1100) =0.03$, so the bounds reported by the forecast of
Planck and CMBPol experiments are more favored for the MHRDE model than in the
case of HRDE cutoff. For the former model, we also obtain that at high redshift
the fraction of dark energy varies from 0.006 to 0.002, then the amount of
$\Omega_x $ at the big bang nucleosynthesis era does not disturb the observed
Helium abundance in the universe provided that the bound $\Omega_{x}(z\simeq

a decay lifetime of about 1 yr induce characteristic suppression in the matter
power spectrum at subgalactic scales through acoustic oscillations in the
thermal background. We explore structure formation in such a model. We also
study three WDM models, where the dark matter particles are produced through
the following mechanisms: i) WDM particles are produced in the thermal
background and then kinematically decoupled; ii) WDM particles are fermions
produced by the decay of thermal heavy bosons; and iii) WDM particles are
produced by the decay of non-relativistic heavy particles. We show that the
linear matter power spectra for the three models are all characterised by the
comoving Jeans scale at the matter-radiation equality. Furthermore, we can also
describe the linear matter power spectrum for the Long-Lived CHAMP model in
terms of a suitably defined characteristic cut-off scale k_{Ch}, similarly to
the WDM models. We perform large cosmological N-body simulations to study the
non-linear growth of structures in these four models. We compare the halo mass
functions, the subhalo mass functions, and the radial distributions of subhalos
in simulated Milky Way-size halos. We study the models with k_{cut}=51, 410,
820 h/Mpc, and confirm that these statistics are indeed similar between the
different WDM models and the Long-Lived CHAMP model. The result suggests that
the cut-off scale k_{cut} not only characterises the linear power spectra but
also can be used to predict the non-linear clustering properties. The radial
distribution of subhalos in Milky Way-size halos is consistent with the
observed distribution for k_{cut}~50-800 h/Mpc; such models resolve the
so-called ""missing satellite problem"".

the measurements indicate that this Higgs-like boson is compatible with the SM
hypothesis, however due to large uncertainties in some of the Higgs detection
channels, one still has the possibility of testing this object as being a
candidate for some Beyond the SM (BSM) physics scenarios, for example, the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), in the CP-conserving version
(CPC-MSSM). In this paper, we evaluate the modifications of these CPC-MSSM
results when CP-violating (CPV) phases are turned on explicitly, leading to the
CP-violating MSSM (CPV-MSSM). We investigate the role of the CPV phases in
(some of) the soft Supersymmetry (SUSY) terms on both the mass of the lightest
Higgs boson $h_1$, and the rates for the processes $gg \rightarrow h_1
\rightarrow \gamma \gamma$, $gg \rightarrow h_1 \rightarrow ZZ^*\rightarrow

V \tau^+\tau^-$, ($V \equiv W^\pm, Z$) at the LHC, considering the impact of
the flavor constraints as well as the constraints coming from the Electric
Dipole Moment (EDM) measurements. We find that the imaginary part of the top
and bottom Yukawa couplings can take very small but non-zero values even after
satisfying the recent updates from LHC. Our study shows that the CPV-MSSM
provides an equally potential solution (like its CP-conserving (CPC)
counterpart) to the recent LHC Higgs data. Improvement in different Higgs
coupling measurements is necessary in order to test the possibility of probing
the small dependence on these CPV phases in the Higgs sector of the MSSM.

flux compression was investigated in ultra-high magnetic fields of up to 700 T.
In an attempt to calibrate the magnetic field measured by pickup coils, precise
Faraday rotation (FR) measurements were conducted on optical (quartz and crown)
glasses. A discernible ""turn-around"" phenomenon was observed in the FR signal
as well as the pickup coils before the end of a liner implosion. We found that
the magnetic field measured by pickup coils should be corrected by taking into
account the high-frequency response of the signal transmission line. Near the
peak magnetic field, however, the pickup coils failed to provide reliable
values, leaving the FR measurement as the only method to precisely measure an
extremely high magnetic fields.

spheres via the harmonic conformal Gauss map using loop groups.
  We first derive a global description of those harmonic maps which can be
realized as conformal Gauss maps of some Willmore surfaces (Theorem 3.4,
Theorem 3.11 and Theorem 3.18).
  Then we introduce the DPW procedure for these harmonic maps, and state
appropriate versions of the Iwasawa decomposition and the Birkhoff
decomposition Theorems. In particular, we show how the harmonic maps associated
with Willmore surfaces can be constructed in terms of loop groups.
  The third main result, which has many implications for the case of Willmore
surfaces in spheres, shows that every harmonic map into some non-compact inner
symmetric space $G/K$ induces a harmonic map into the compact dual inner
symmetric space $U/{(U \cap K^\mathbb{C})}$. From this correspondence we obtain
additional information about the global properties of harmonic maps into
non-compact inner symmetric spaces.
  As an illustration of the theory developed in this paper we list examples
(some of which were worked out in separate papers by following the theory of
the present paper). In particular, we present an explicit, unbranched
(isotropic) Willmore sphere in $S^6$ which is not S-Willmore, and thus does not
have a dual Willmore surface. This example gives a negative answer to a long
open problem (originally posed by Ejiri).

piecewise continuous linear repulsive potential wall having a constant slope
$a$. We derive an explicit analytical expression for an inevitable energy

parameters: 1) $\alpha$, which is a fraction of time step $\tau$ immediately
after the collision with the potential wall, and 2) $\mu \equiv \frac{a
\tau}{p_0}$, where $p_0$ is the momentum immediately before the collision. The
whole space of parameters $\alpha$ and $\mu$ can be divided into an infinite
number of regions, where each region creates a positive or negative energy
change $\Delta E$. On the boundaries of these regions, energy does not change,
\textit{i.e}, $\Delta E=0$. The envelope of $|\Delta E|$ \textit{vs.} $\mu$
shows a power law behavior $|\Delta E| \propto \mu^\beta$, with the exponent
$\beta \approx 0.95$. This implies that the round-off error in energy
introduced by the discreteness is nearly proportional to the discrete time step

computation via crowdsourcing. Multiple choice (or labeling) questions could be
referred to as a common type of problem which is solved by this approach. As an
application, crowd labeling is applied to find true labels for large machine
learning datasets. Since crowds are not necessarily experts, the labels they
provide are rather noisy and erroneous. This challenge is usually resolved by
collecting multiple labels for each sample, and then aggregating them to
estimate the true label. Although the mechanism leads to high-quality labels,
it is not actually cost-effective. As a result, efforts are currently made to
maximize the accuracy in estimating true labels, while fixing the number of
acquired labels.
  This paper surveys methods to aggregate redundant crowd labels in order to
estimate unknown true labels. It presents a unified statistical latent model
where the differences among popular methods in the field correspond to
different choices for the parameters of the model. Afterwards, algorithms to
make inference on these models will be surveyed. Moreover, adaptive methods
which iteratively collect labels based on the previously collected labels and
estimated models will be discussed. In addition, this paper compares the
distinguished methods, and provides guidelines for future work required to
address the current open issues.

create non-Gaussianity in curvature perturbations. We found that such
non-Gaussianity closely resembles the local-type non-Gaussianity parametrized
by $f_{\rm NL}$, and generates scale-dependent bias in large-scale structures.
We also found a simple relationship between the scale-dependent bias and the
power spectrum of the vector fields. When the vector fields are interpreted as
primordial magnetic fields, the effective $f_{\rm NL}$ is shown to be always
negative. The scale-dependent bias provides a new approach to probing
primordial vector fields.

resonators have shown significant potential for sensing and high frequency
signal processing applications. This is due to their excellent features like
small size, large frequency-quality factor product, low power consumption, low
cost batch fabrication, and integrability with CMOS IC technology. Radio
frequency communication circuits like reference oscillators, filters, and
mixers based on such MEMS resonators can be utilized for meeting the increasing
count of RF components likely to be demanded by the next generation
multi-band/multi-mode wireless devices. MEMS resonators can provide a feasible
alternative to the present day well established quartz crystal technology that
is riddled with major drawbacks like relatively large size, high cost, and low
compatibility with IC chips. This article presents a survey of the developments
in this field of resonant MEMS structures with detailed enumeration on the
various micromechanical resonator types, modes of vibration, equivalent
mechanical and electrical models, materials and technologies used for
fabrication, and the application of the resonators for implementing oscillators
and filters. These are followed by a discussion on the challenges for RF MEMS
technology in comparison to quartz crystal technology; like high precision,
stability, reliability, need for hermetic packaging etc. which remain to be
addressed for enabling the inclusion of micromechanical resonators into
tomorrow's highly integrated communication systems.

  Deforms corresponding to nontrivial cohomology classes can be isomorphic to
the initial algebra, e.g., we confirm Grishkov's implicit claim and explicitly
describe the Jurman algebra as such a ""semitrivial"" deform of the derived of
the alternate Hamiltonian Lie algebra. This paper helps to sharpen the
formulation of a conjecture describing all simple finite-dimensional Lie
algebras over any algebraically closed field of nonzero characteristic and
supports a conjecture of Dzhumadildaev and Kostrikin stating that all simple
finite-dimensional modular Lie algebras are either of ""standard"" type or

(SO) coupling is present and inversion symmetry is absent. In two-dimensional
electron systems (2DES) spin-degeneracy is lifted by Rashba interaction terms -
symmetry invariants that are scalar products of spin and orbital axial vectors.
Rashba interactions are symmetry allowed whenever a 2DES is not invariant under
reflections through the plane it occupies. In this paper, we use a
tight-binding model informed by ab initio electronic structure calculations to
develop a theory of Rashba splitting in the t2g bands of the two- dimensional
electron systems formed at cubic perovskite crystal surfaces and interfaces. We
find that Rashba splitting in these systems is due to atomic-like on-site SO
interactions combined with processes in which t2g electrons change orbital
character when they hop between metal sites. These processes are absent in a
cubic environment and are due primarily to polar lattice distortions which
alter the metal-oxygen-metal bond angle.

one of the predefined set of classes. The content based document classification
uses the content of the document with some weighting criteria to assign it to
one of the predefined classes. It is a major task in library science,
electronic document management systems and information sciences. This paper
investigates document classification by using two different classification
techniques (1) Support Vector Machine (SVM) and (2) Relevance Vector Machine
(RVM). SVM is a supervised machine learning technique that can be used for
classification task. In its basic form, SVM represents the instances of the
data into space and tries to separate the distinct classes by a maximum
possible wide gap (hyper plane) that separates the classes. On the other hand
RVM uses probabilistic measure to define this separation space. RVM uses
Bayesian inference to obtain succinct solution, thus RVM uses significantly
fewer basis functions. Experimental studies on three standard text
classification datasets reveal that although RVM takes more training time, its
classification is much better as compared to SVM.

simulate the tensile elongations of short (2-2.5 nm) armchair and zigzag Single
Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) without bond breakings or defect formation.
Simulations are repeated at high temperatures. We fix the lower limit of
breaking strains to short SWCNTs without bond breaking or 5-7 defects
formation. At room temperature, the simulated (4,4) SWCNT is able to carry the
strain up to 130% of the relaxed tube length without bond breaking or 5-7
defects formation. This value is 127% for (11,0) SWCNT, 125% for (17,0) SWCNT,
123% for (10,10) SWCNT. In defect free, short nanotubes as the nanotube's
radius increase the bond-breakings occur at lower strain values regardless of
their chirality. This is true when we heat the tubes to higher temperatures.
Bond breaking strain values, tensile strength, Young's modulus of the SWCNTs
are obtained as functions of temperature. Defect free zigzag nanotubes exhibit
higher tensile strength than armchaired ones. Young's modulus of defect free
individual singlewall nanotubes is found to be in the range of 0.400 TPa within
the elastic limit. At room temperature and experimentally realizable strain
values, thinner tubes are more resistant to bond breaking and zigzag tubes over
armchair ones. At high temperatures although the resistance to strain drops the
same trend still holds. We observe a slight decrease of the tensile strength
with increasing temperatures. The same trend is also observed in the Young's
modulus. Results are important in determining a true breaking strains of
SWCNTs.

thermodynamic observables in QCD, through lattice simulations with 1+1+1
flavors of staggered quarks at physical quark masses. Continuum extrapolated
results are presented for the light quark condensates and for their tensor
polarizations, as functions of the temperature and the magnetic field. We find
the light condensates to undergo inverse magnetic catalysis in the transition
region, in a manner that the transition temperature decreases with growing
magnetic field. We also compare the results to other approaches and lattice
simulations. Furthermore, we relate the tensor polarization to the spin part of
the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD vacuum, and show that this contribution
is diamagnetic.

High-resolution neutron powder diffraction indicates the existence of two

changes in the Na mobility. Our data are consistent with a two-step

in automata networks used to model biochemical regulation and signalling. In
our formulation, canalization becomes synonymous with redundancy present in the
logic of automata. This results in straightforward measures to quantify
canalization in an automaton (micro-level), which is in turn integrated into a
highly scalable framework to characterize the collective dynamics of
large-scale automata networks (macro-level). This way, our approach provides a
method to link micro- to macro-level dynamics -- a crux of complexity. Several
new results ensue from this methodology: uncovering of dynamical modularity
(modules in the dynamics rather than in the structure of networks),
identification of minimal conditions and critical nodes to control the
convergence to attractors, simulation of dynamical behaviour from incomplete
information about initial conditions, and measures of macro-level canalization
and robustness to perturbations. We exemplify our methodology with a well-known
model of the intra- and inter cellular genetic regulation of body segmentation
in Drosophila melanogaster. We use this model to show that our analysis does
not contradict any previous findings. But we also obtain new knowledge about
its behaviour: a better understanding of the size of its wild-type attractor
basin (larger than previously thought), the identification of novel minimal
conditions and critical nodes that control wild-type behaviour, and the
resilience of these to stochastic interventions. Our methodology is applicable
to any complex network that can be modelled using automata, but we focus on
biochemical regulation and signalling, towards a better understanding of the
(decentralized) control that orchestrates cellular activity -- with the
ultimate goal of explaining how do cells and tissues 'compute'.

low-energy (~6 eV) cluster ion beam deposition under ultrahigh vacuum
conditions. The topographic and electronic properties of the deposits were
monitored by means of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM at 4.2 K).
Topographic images reveal that at low coverages fullerene cages are pinned by
point dislocation defects on the herringbone reconstructed gold terraces (as
well as by step edges). At intermediate coverages, pinned monomers, act as
nucleation centres for the formation of oligomeric C58 chains and 2D islands.
At the largest coverages studied, the surface becomes covered by 3D interlinked
C58 cages. STM topographic images of pinned single adsorbates are essentially
featureless. The corresponding local densities of states are consistent with
strong cage-substrate interactions. Topographic images of [C58]n oligomers show
a stripe-like intensity pattern oriented perpendicular to the axis connecting
the cage centers. This striped pattern becomes even more pronounced in maps of
the local density of states. As supported by density functional theory, DFT
calculations, and also by analogous STM images previously obtained for C60
polymers (M. Nakaya et al., J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol. 11, 2829 (2011)), we
conclude that these striped orbital patterns are a fingerprint of covalent
intercage bonds. For thick C58 films we have derived a band gap of 1.2 eV from
scanning tunnelling spectroscopy data, STS, confirming that the outermost C58
layer behaves as a wide band semiconductor.

Gould Belt super-association is responsible for bright diffuse foregrounds that
we observe from our position inside the system and that can help us improve our
knowledge of the Galactic emission. Free-free emission and anomalous microwave
emission (AME) are the dominant components at low frequencies (\nu < 40 GHz),
while synchrotron emission is very smooth and faint. We separate diffuse
free-free emission and AME from synchrotron emission and thermal dust emission
by using Planck data, complemented by ancillary data, using the ""Correlated
Component Analysis"" (CCA) component separation method and we compare with the
results of cross-correlation of foreground templates with the frequency maps.
We estimate the electron temperature T_e from H$\alpha$ and free-free emission
using two methods (temperature-temperature plot and cross-correlation) and we
obtain T_e ranging from 3100 to 5200 K, for an effective fraction of absorbing
dust along the line of sight of 30% (f_d=0.3). We estimate the frequency
spectrum of the diffuse AME and we recover a peak frequency (in flux density
units) of 25.5 \pm 1.5 GHz. We verify the reliability of this result with
realistic simulations that include the presence of biases in the spectral model
for the AME and in the free-free template. By combining physical models for
vibrational and rotational dust emission and adding the constraints from the
thermal dust spectrum from Planck and IRAS we are able to get a good
description of the frequency spectrum of the AME for plausible values of the
local density and radiation field.

({\bf k}_3), which we call ""the fourth variety"", in the collapsed (for
\tau_{NL}) and squeezed (for f_{NL}) limits is always satisfied independently
of any physics; however, the proof depends sensitively on the assumption of
scale-invariance which only applies for cosmological models involving
Lorentz-invariant scalar fields (at least at tree level), leaving room for a
strong violation of this variety of the consistency relation when non-trivial
degrees of freedom, for instance vector fields, are in charge of the generation
of \zeta. With this in mind as a motivation, we explicitly state under which
conditions the SY consistency relation has been claimed to hold in its
different varieties (implicitly) presented in the literature; as a result, we
show for the first time that the variety \tau_{NL} ({\bf k}_1, {\bf k}_1)
\geqslant ((6/5) f_{NL} ({\bf k}_1))^2, which we call ""the fifth variety"", is
always satisfied even when there is strong scale-dependence as long as
statistical homogeneity holds: thus, an observed violation of this specific
variety would prevent the comparison between theory and observation, shaking
this way the foundations of cosmology as a science. Later, we concern about the
existence of non-trivial degrees of freedom, concretely vector fields for which
the levels of non-gaussianity have been calculated for very few models, finding
that the fourth variety of the SY consistency relation is indeed strongly
violated for some specific wavevector configurations while the fifth variety
continues to be well satisfied. (Abridged)

reduction from these games to a subclass of anonymous games, we give

used to detect the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (iSW). When focusing on the
locations of superstructures identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),
Granett et al. (2008a, Gr08) found a signal with strong significance and an
amplitude reportedly higher than expected within the LambdaCDM paradigm. We
revisit the analysis using our own robust protocol, and extend the study to the
two most recent and largest catalogues of voids publicly available. We quantify
and subtract the level of foreground contamination in the stacked images and
determine the contribution on the largest angular scales from the first
multipoles of the CMB. We obtain the radial temperature and photometry profiles
from the stacked images. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we computed the
statistical significance of the profiles for each catalogue and identified the
angular scale at which the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is maximum. We
essentially confirm the signal detection reported by Gr08, but for the other
two catalogues, a rescaling of the voids to the same size on the stacked image
is needed to find any significant signal (with a maximum at ~2.4 sigmas). This
procedure reveals that the photometry peaks at unexpectedly large angles in the
case of the Gr08 voids, in contrast to voids from other catalogues. Conversely,
the photometry profiles derived from the stacked voids of these other
catalogues contain small central hot spots of uncertain origin. We also stress
the importance of a posteriori selection effects that might arise when
intending to increase the S/N, and we discuss the possible impact of void
overlap and alignment effects. We argue that the interpretation in terms of an
iSW effect of any detected signal via the stacking method is far from obvious.

Using a discrete solitary mode of uncoupled spin components as an initial
condition, the time evolution of this many-body system is found to be
characterized by two dominant frequencies leading to quasiperiodic dynamics at
various sites. The dynamics of spatially-averaged and spin-averaged degrees of
freedom, however, is periodic enabling an unique identification of the two
frequencies. By increasing the spin-dependent atom-atom interaction strength we
observe a resonance state, where the ratio of the two frequencies is a
characteristic integer multiple and the spin-and-spatial degrees of freedom
oscillate in ""unison"". Crucially, this resonant state is found to signal the
onset to chaotic dynamics characterized by a broad band spectrum. In a
ferromagnetic spinor condensate with attractive spin-dependent interactions,
the resonance is accompanied by a transition from oscillatory- to
rotational-type dynamics as the time evolution of the relative phase of the
matter wave of the individual spin projections changes from bounded to
unbounded.

liquids) simultaneously deform or display collective behaviors, while
undergoing atomic scale vibrations and collisions. While the multiple
space-time character of such systems often makes traditional molecular dynamics
simulation impractical, a multiscale approach has been presented that allows
for long-time simulation with atomic detail based on the co-evolution of
slowly-varying order parameters (OPs) with the quasi-equilibrium probability
density of atomic configurations. However, this approach breaks down when the
structural change is extreme, or when nearest-neighbor connectivity of atoms is
not maintained. In the current study, a self-consistent approach is presented
wherein OPs and a reference structure co-evolve slowly to yield long-time
simulation for dynamical soft-matter phenomena such as structural transitions
and self assembly. The development begins with the Liouville equation for N
classical atoms and an ansatz on the form of the associated N-atom probability
density. Multiscale techniques are used to derive Langevin equations for the
coupled OP configurational dynamics. The net result is a set of equations for
the coupled stochastic dynamics of the OPs and centers of mass of the
subsystems that constitute a soft material body. The theory is based on an
all-atom methodology and an interatomic force field, and therefore enables
calibration-free simulations of soft matter, such as macromolecular assemblies.

perspective an enhancement of the channel pp->h->\gamma\gamma turns out to be
possible, if one considers constraints on the parameters from the full
structure of the composite models, the decay mode into photons is always
reduced. We also demonstrate that taking into account the non-linearity of the

the issue of torsion and argue that spinfoam gravity may indeed miss an

identified in white light images of CMEs as narrow rays trailing the outward
moving CME core, and in ultraviolet spectra as narrow bright features emitting
the Fe XVIII line. In this work samples of rays detected in white light images

intensities of the rays have been measured, and their correlation to the CME
properties has been studied. The samples show a wide range of temperatures with
hot, coronal and cool rays. In some cases, the UV spectra support the
identification of rays as current sheets, but they show that some white light
rays are cool material from the CME core. In many cases, both hot and cool
material are present, but offset from each other along the UltraViolet

about 23% show cold gas that we attribute to cool prominence material draining
back from the CME core. The remaining events have ordinary coronal
temperatures, perhaps because they have relaxed back to a quiescent state.

(N=2 systems). Our N=2 systems are widely-separated (up to
$\sim$\,200\,$h^{-1}$\,kpc), where close galaxy-galaxy interactions are not
dominant. We apply our selection criteria to two volume-limited samples of
galaxies from SDSS DR6 with $M_{r}-5 \log_{10} h \leq$ -19 and -20 to study the
effects of the environment of very sparse groups on galaxy colour. For
satellite galaxies in a group of two, we find a red excess attributed to star
formation quenching of 0.15\,$\pm$\,0.01 and 0.14\,$\pm$\,0.01 for the -19 and
-20 samples, respectively, relative to isolated galaxies of the same stellar
mass. Assuming N=1 systems are the progenitors of N=2 systems, an
immediate-rapid star formation quenching scenario is inconsistent with these
observations. A delayed-then-rapid star formation quenching scenario with a
delay time of 3.3 and 3.7\,Gyr for the -19 and -20 samples, respectively,
yields a red excess prediction in agreement with the observations. The
observations also reveal that central galaxies in a group of two have a slight
blue excess of 0.06\,$\pm$\,0.02 and 0.02\,$\pm$\,0.01 for the -19 and -20
samples, respectively, relative to N=1 populations of the same stellar mass.
Our results demonstrate that even the environment of very sparse groups of

simple systems are an essential step towards understanding galaxy evolution in
general.

large size and the high dimensionality of time series databases that are in use
nowadays make that scenario inefficient. There are many representation
techniques that aim at reducing the dimensionality of time series so that the
search can be handled faster at a lower-dimensional space level. The symbolic
aggregate approximation (SAX) is one of the most competitive methods in the
literature. In this paper we present a new method that improves the performance
of SAX by adding to it another exclusion condition that increases the exclusion
power. This method is based on using two representations of the time series:
one of SAX and the other is based on an optimal approximation of the time
series. Pre-computed distances are calculated and stored offline to be used
online to exclude a wide range of the search space using two exclusion
conditions. We conduct experiments which show that the new method is faster

mid-infrared high spatial resolution observations from the ESO-VLTI focal
instrument MIDI. The aim of this study is to provide observational constraints
on theoretical prediction that the winds of M-type AGB objects can be driven by
photon scattering on iron-free silicate grains located in the close environment
(about 2 to 3 stellar radii) of the star. We interpreted
spectro-interferometric data, first using wavelength-dependent geometric
models. We then used a self-consistent dynamic model atmosphere containing a
time-dependent description of grain growth for pure forsterite dust particles
to reproduce the photometric, spectrometric, and interferometric measurements
of RT Vir. Since the hydrodynamic computation needs stellar parameters as
input, a considerable effort was first made to determine these parameters. MIDI
differential phases reveal the presence of an asymmetry in the stellar
vicinity. Results from the geometrical modeling give us clues to the presence
of aluminum and silicate dust in the close circumstellar environment (< ~5
stellar radii). Comparison between spectro-interferometric data and a
self-consistent dust-driven wind model reveals that silicate dust has to be
present in the region between 2 to 3 stellar radii to reproduce the 59 and 63 m
baseline visibility measurements around 9.8 micron. This gives additional
observational evidence in favor of winds driven by photon scattering on
iron-free silicate grains located in the close vicinity of an M-type star.
However, other sources of opacity are clearly missing to reproduce the 10-13
micron visibility measurements for all baselines. This study is a first attempt
to understand the wind mechanism of M-type AGB stars by comparing photometric,
spectrometric, and interferometric measurements with state-of-the-art,
self-consistent dust-driven wind models. The agreement of the dynamic model
atmosphere with interferometric measurements in the 8-10 micron spectral region
gives additional observational evidence that the winds of M-type stars can be
driven by photon scattering on iron-free silicate grains. Finally, a larger
statistical study and progress in advanced self-consistent 3D modeling are
still required to solve the remaining problems.

bipartite correlations (yielding both pessimistic and optimistic results), only
little is known in the multi-partite case. We show that a natural

adaptive protocol, to the algebraic maximum. We use this result further to show
that a much bigger class of correlations, including all purely three-partite
correlations, can be distilled from arbitrarily weak to maximal strength with
partial communication, i.e., using only a subset of the channels required for
the creation of the same correlation from scratch. In other words, we show that

more detailed analyses are needed of the occurrence frequencies of low-mass

There is a growing need to quickly assess the characteristics of a graph in
order to understand its underlying structure. Some of the most useful metrics
are triangle-based and give a measure of the connectedness of mutual friends.
This is often summarized in terms of clustering coefficients, which measure the
likelihood that two neighbors of a node are themselves connected. Computing
these measures exactly for large-scale networks is prohibitively expensive in
both memory and time. However, a recent wedge sampling algorithm has proved
successful in efficiently and accurately estimating clustering coefficients. In
this paper, we describe how to implement this approach in MapReduce to deal
with massive graphs. We show results on publicly-available networks, the
largest of which is 132M nodes and 4.7B edges, as well as artificially
generated networks (using the Graph500 benchmark), the largest of which has
240M nodes and 8.5B edges. We can estimate the clustering coefficient by degree
bin (e.g., we use exponential binning) and the number of triangles per bin, as
well as the global clustering coefficient and total number of triangles, in an
average of 0.33 seconds per million edges plus overhead (approximately 225
seconds total for our configuration). The technique can also be used to study
triangle statistics such as the ratio of the highest and lowest degree, and we
highlight differences between social and non-social networks. To the best of
our knowledge, these are the largest triangle-based graph computations
published to date.

individuals may respond differently to their neighbours depending on their
relative state of motion (approach versus movement away). Based on the
formulation of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, we derive a kinetic
description of the system dynamics in terms of equations for the Fourier modes
of a one-particle density function. This approach allows effective numerical
investigation of the stability of possible solutions of the system. The
detailed analysis of the interaction integrals entering the equations
demonstrates that divergences at small wavelengths can appear at arbitrary
expansion orders.
  Further on, we also derive a hydrodynamic theory by performing a closure at
the level of the second Fourier mode of the one-particle density function. We
show that the general form of equations is in agreement with the theory
formulated by Toner and Tu.
  Finally, we compare our analytical predictions on the stability of the
disordered homogeneous solution with results of individual-based simulations.
They show good agreement for sufficiently large densities and non-negligible
short-ranged repulsion. Disagreements of numerical results and the hydrodynamic
theory for weak short-ranged repulsion reveal the existence of a previously
unknown phase of the model consisting of dense, nematically aligned filaments,
which cannot be accounted for by the present Toner and Tu type theory of polar
active matter.

matrix operating on the vector of unknowns. This product calculation can be
performed efficiently using FFT routines. Second, to overcome the limitation of
single precision inherent in GPU, a {\delta}f type method is adopted which only
needs refinement in specialized areas of phase space but not throughout. Thus,
a GPU Vlasov-Poisson solver can indeed perform high precision simulations
(since it uses very high order reconstruction methods and a large number of

dust-obscured gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by the Swift satellite during
the years 2005-2009, representing all GRBs with an unambiguous host-frame
extinction of A_V>1 mag from this period. Deep observations with Keck, Gemini,
VLT, HST, and Spitzer successfully detect the host galaxies and establish
spectroscopic or photometric redshifts for all 23 events, enabling us to
provide measurements of the intrinsic host star-formation rates, stellar
masses, and mean extinctions. Compared to the hosts of unobscured GRBs at
similar redshifts, we find that the hosts of dust-obscured GRBs are (on
average) more massive by about an order of magnitude and also more rapidly
star-forming and dust-obscured. While this demonstrates that GRBs populate all
types of star-forming galaxies including the most massive, luminous systems at
z~2, at redshifts below 1.5 the overall GRB population continues to show a
highly significant aversion away from massive galaxies and a preference for
low-mass systems relative to what would be expected given a purely SFR-selected
galaxy sample. This supports the notion that the GRB rate is strongly dependent
on metallicity, and may suggest that the most massive galaxies in the Universe
underwent a transition in their chemical properties ~9 Gyr ago. We also
conclude that, based on the absence of unobscured GRBs in massive galaxies and
the absence of obscured GRBs in low-mass galaxies, the dust distributions of
the lowest-mass and the highest-mass galaxies are relatively homogeneous, while
intermediate-mass galaxies (~10^9 M_sun) have diverse internal properties.

is optimized for robustly identifying candidate high-redshift galaxy clusters

is a fusion of the well-tested cluster red-sequence method of Gladders & Yee
(2000) with the MIR 3.6um - 4.5um cluster detection method developed by
Papovich (2008). As with the cluster red-sequence method, the SBS identifies
candidate overdensities within 3.6um - 4.5um color slices, which are the
equivalent of a rest-frame 1.6um stellar bump ""red-sequence"". In addition to
employing the MIR colors of galaxies, the SBS algorithm incorporates an
optical/MIR (z' - 3.6um) color cut. This cut effectively eliminates foreground
0.2 < z < 0.4 galaxies which have 3.6um - 4.5um colors that are similarly red
as z > 1.0 galaxies and add noise when searching for high-redshift galaxy
overdensities. We demonstrate using the z ~ 1 GCLASS cluster sample that
similar to the red sequence, the stellar bump sequence appears to be a
ubiquitous feature of high-redshift clusters, and that within that sample the
color of the stellar bump sequence increases monotonically with redshift and
provides photometric redshifts accurate to dz = 0.05. We apply the SBS method
in the XMM-LSS SWIRE field and show that it robustly recovers the majority of
confirmed optical, MIR, and X-ray-selected clusters at z > 1.0 in that field.
Lastly, we present confirmation of SpARCS J022427-032354 at z = 1.63, a new

infrared galaxy merger NGC 6240, which allows a detailed investigation of the
diffuse galactic halo. Extended soft X-ray emission is detected at the 3-sigma
confidence level over a diamond-shaped region with projected physical size of
~110x80 kpc, and a single-component thermal model provides a reasonably good
fit to the observed X-ray spectrum. The hot gas has a temperature of ~7.5
million K, an estimated density of 2.5x10^{-3} cm^{-3}, and a total mass of
~10^10 M_sun, resulting in an intrinsic 0.4-2.5 keV luminosity of 4x10^41 erg
s^{-1}. The average temperature of 0.65 keV is quite high to be obviously
related to either the binding energy in the dark-matter gravitational potential
of the system or the energy dissipation and shocks following the galactic
collision, yet the spatially-resolved spectral analysis reveals limited
variations across the halo. The relative abundance of the main alpha-elements
with respect to iron is several times the solar value, and nearly constant as
well, implying a uniform enrichment by type II supernovae out to the largest
scales. Taken as a whole, the observational evidence is not compatible with a
superwind originated by a recent, nuclear starburst, but rather hints at
widespread, enhanced star formation proceeding at steady rate over the entire
dynamical timescale (~200 Myr). The preferred scenario is that of a
starburst-processed gas component gently expanding into, and mixing with, a
pre-existing halo medium of lower metallicity (Z ~ 0.1 solar) and temperature
(kT ~ 0.25 keV). This picture cannot be probed more extensively with the
present data, and the ultimate fate of the diffuse, hot gas remains uncertain.
Under some favorable conditions, at least a fraction of it might be retained
after the merger completion, and evolve into the hot halo of a young elliptical
galaxy.

four days before maximum. Four different spectral indices were used for the
spectral classification at these two phases, all of them well-suited for

four days before maximum the derived SpT is M5.75. The derived SpTs confirm
that CHS7797 has a mass in the stellar-substellar boundary mass range. In
addition, the small differences in the derived SpTs at the two observed phases

take advantage of the embarrassingly parallel feature of boundary integral

obtain emission line profiles across the regions to study the location of the

to the morphology, showing that the star and gas-dust configuration affects the
ratios of the emission in different bands. The mixed and filled regions show
higher emission at 24mi than the shells and clear shells, which could be due to
the proximity of the dust to the stellar clusters in the case of mixed and
filled regions. The FIR peak for shells and clear shells seems to be located
towards longer wavelengths, indicating that the dust is colder for this type of
objects.The logarithmic 100/70mi ratio for filled and mixed regions remains
constant over one order of magnitude in Halpha and FUV surface brightness,

the hypothesis of urban scaling, namely that certain properties of all cities

emergence of these scaling relations depends on a few general properties of
cities as social networks, co-located in space and time, that conceivably apply
to a wide range of human settlements. Here, we discuss the present evidence for
the hypothesis of urban scaling, some of the methodological issues dealing with
proxy measurements and units of analysis and place these findings in the

been predicted for some close pre-main sequence binary stars as they grow from
circumbinary disks. The phenomenon is known as ""pulsed accretion"" and can
affect the orbital evolution and mass distribution of young binaries, as well
as the potential for planet formation in the circumbinary environment.
Accretion variability is a common feature of young stars, with a large range of
amplitudes and timescales as measured from multi-epoch observations at optical
and infrared wavelengths. Periodic variations consistent with pulsed accretion
have been seen in only a few young binaries via optical accretion tracers,
albeit intermittently with accretion luminosity variations ranging from 0-50
percent from orbit to orbit. Here we report on a young protostar (age ~10^5 yr)
that exhibits periodic variability in which the infrared luminosity increases
by a factor of 10 in roughly one week every 25.34 days. We attribute this to
pulsed accretion associated with an unseen binary companion. The strength and
regularity of this accretion signal is surprising; it may be related to the
very young age of the system, which is a factor of ten younger than the other
pulsed accretors previously studied.

space time, and show how to define the analog of the Unruh effect for a one
parameter set of accelerated observers in a causal diamond in Minkowski space.
The key fact is that the formalism splits the degrees of freedom in a large
causal diamond into particles and excitations on the horizon. The latter form a
large heat bath for the particles, and different Hamiltonians, describing a one
parameter family of accelerated trajectories, have different couplings to the
bath. We argue that for a large but finite causal diamond the Hamiltonian
describing a geodesic observer has a residual coupling to the bath and that the
effect of the bath is finite over the long time interval in the diamond. We
find general forms of the Hamiltonian, which guarantee that the horizon degrees
of freedom will decouple in the limit of large diamonds, leaving over a unitary
evolution operator for particles, with an asymptotically conserved energy. That
operator converges to the S-matrix in the infinite diamond limit. The S-matrix
thus arises from integrating out the horizon degrees of freedom, in a manner
reminiscent of, but distinct from, Matrix Theory. We note that this model for
the S-matrix implies that Quantum Gravity, as opposed to quantum field theory,
has a natural adiabatic switching off of the interactions. We argue that
imposing Lorentz invariance on the S-matrix is natural, and guarantees
super-Poincare invariance in the HST formalism. Spatial translation invariance
is seen to be the residuum of the consistency conditions of HST.

using the Hartle-Thorne slow-rotation method with a wide range of equations of
state, focusing on the values obtained for the angular momentum $J$ and the
quadrupole moment $Q$, when the gravitational mass $M$ and the rotational
frequency $\Omega$ are specified. Building on previous work, which showed
surprising uniformity in the behaviour of the moment of inertia for
neutron-star models constructed with widely-different equations of state, we
find similar uniformity for the quadrupole moment. These two quantities,
together with the mass, are fundamental for determining the vacuum space-time
outside neutron stars. We study particularly the dimensionless combination of
parameters $QM/J^2$ (using units for which $c=G=1$). This quantity goes to 1 in
the case of a Kerr-metric black hole and deviations away from 1 then
characterize the difference between neutron-star and black-hole space-times. It
is found that $QM/J^2$ for both neutron stars and strange stars decreases with
increasing mass, for a given equation of state, reaching a value of around 2
(or even less) for maximum-mass models, meaning that their external space-time
is then rather well approximated by the Kerr metric. If $QM/J^2$ is plotter
against compactness $R/2M$ (where $R$ is the radius), it is found that the
relationship is nearly unique for neutron-star models, independent of the
equation of state, while it is significantly different for strange stars. This
gives a new way of possibly distinguishing between them.

Kerr-dS black holes in all dimensions and Kerr-Newman-dS black holes in D=4. We
also show that the Chong-Cvetic-Lu-Pope solution of D=5 minimal supergravity,

of galaxies were drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and used to
generate compact sets of `continuum' and `emission-line' component spectra.
These components can be linearly combined to reconstruct the observed spectra
of a wider sample of galaxies. Only 10 components - five continuum and five
emission line - are required to produce accurate reconstructions of essentially
all narrow emission-line galaxies; the median absolute deviations of the
reconstructed emission-line fluxes, given the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of
the observed spectra, are 1.2-1.8 sigma for the strong lines. After applying
the MFICA components to a large sample of SDSS galaxies we identify the regions
of parameter space that correspond to pure star formation and pure active
galactic nucleus (AGN) emission-line spectra, and produce high S/N
reconstructions of these spectra.
  The physical properties of the pure star formation and pure AGN spectra are
investigated by means of a series of photoionization models, exploiting the
faint emission lines that can be measured in the reconstructions. We are able
to recreate the emission line strengths of the most extreme AGN case by
assuming the central engine illuminates a large number of individual clouds
with radial distance and density distributions, f(r) ~ r^gamma and g(n) ~
n^beta, respectively. The best fit is obtained with gamma = -0.75 and beta =
-1.4. From the reconstructed star formation spectra we are able to estimate the
starburst ages. These preliminary investigations serve to demonstrate the
success of the MFICA-based technique in identifying distinct emission sources,
and its potential as a tool for the detailed analysis of the physical
properties of galaxies in large-scale surveys.

two-component emission features with independent radial velocity variations as

of 41 MG. The period of the radial velocity and cyclotron hump variations are
consistent with the previously-known photometric period, and the spectroscopic
flux variations are consistent in amplitude with previous photometric amplitude
measurements. The secondary star is also detected in the spectrum. We also
present polarimetric imaging measurements of EU Cnc that show a clear detection
of polarization, and the degree of polarization drops below our detection
threshold at phases when the cyclotron emission features are fading or not

properties remain unchanged. Such time- invariant properties are generally
interesting, because they tend to reflect some fundamental processes or
constraints behind Internet growth. As has been shown before, the
time-invariant structural properties of the Internet include some most basic
ones, such as the degree distribution or clustering. Here we add to this
time-invariant list a non-trivial property - k-dense decomposition. This
property is derived from a recursive form of edge multiplicity, defined as the
number of triangles that share a given edge. We show that after proper
normalization, the k- dense decomposition of the Internet has remained stable
over the last decade, even though the Internet size has approximately doubled,
and so has the k-density of its k-densest core. This core consists mostly of
content providers peering at Internet eXchange Points, and it only loosely
overlaps with the high-degree or high-rank AS core, consisting mostly of tier-1
transit providers. We thus show that high degrees and high k-densities reflect
two different Internet-specific properties of ASes (transit versus content
providers). As a consequence, even though degrees and k-densities of nodes are
correlated, the relative fluctuations are strong, and related to that, random
graphs with the same degree distribution or even degree correlations as in the
Internet, do not reproduce its k-dense decomposition. Therefore an interesting
open question is what Internet topology models or generators can fully explain
or at least reproduce the k-dense properties of the Internet.

diverse markets and get an arbitrage opportunity, and this makes these markets
interesting. A feature of real-world markets is that stocks with smaller
capitalizations have larger drift coefficients. Some models, like the
Volatility-Stabilized Model, try to capture this property, but they are not

different types of players were identified with each one having at least one

viruses, replicate in large viral factories, and tend to infect protists. The
giant virus replication factories can in turn be infected by so called
virophages, which are smaller viruses that negatively impact giant virus
replication. An example are Mimiviruses that infect the protist Acanthamoeba
and that are themselves infected by the virophage Sputnik. This paper examines
the evolutionary dynamics of this system, using mathematical models. While the
models suggest that the virophage population will evolve to increasing degrees
of giant virus inhibition, it further suggests that this renders the virophage
population prone to extinction due to dynamic instabilities over wide parameter
ranges. Implications and conditions required to avoid extinction are discussed.
Another interesting result is that virophage presence can fundamentally alter
the evolutionary course of the giant virus. While the giant virus is predicted
to evolve towards increasing its basic reproductive ratio in the absence of the
virophage, the opposite is true its presence. Therefore, virophages can not
only benefit the host population directly by inhibiting the giant viruses, but
also indirectly by causing giant viruses to evolve towards weaker phenotypes.
Experimental tests for this model are suggested.

diagnosis is appealing yet performance varies widely depending on the disease
and genomic risk score (GRS) method. Celiac disease (CD), a common
immune-mediated illness, is strongly genetically determined and requires
specific HLA haplotypes. HLA testing can exclude diagnosis but has low
specificity, providing little information suitable for clinical risk
stratification. Using six European CD cohorts, we provide a proof-of-concept
that statistical learning approaches which simultaneously model all SNPs can
generate robust and highly accurate predictive models based on genome-wide SNP
profiles. The high predictive capacity replicated both in cross-validation
within each cohort (AUC of 0.87-0.89) and in independent replication across
cohorts (AUC of 0.86-0.9), despite differences in ethnicity. The models
explained 30-35% of disease variance and up to $\sim43\%$ of heritability. The
GRS's utility was assessed in different clinically relevant settings.
Comparable to HLA typing, the GRS can be used to identify individuals without
CD with $\geq99.6\%$ negative predictive value however, unlike HLA typing,
patients can also be stratified into categories of higher-risk for CD who would
benefit from more invasive and costly definitive testing. The GRS is flexible
and its performance can be adapted to the clinical situation by adjusting the
threshold cut-off. Despite explaining a minority of disease heritability, our
findings indicate a predictive GRS provides clinically relevant information to
improve upon current diagnostic pathways for CD, and support further studies
evaluating the clinical utility of this approach in CD and other complex
diseases.

existing works have not considered quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for
two-way relaying. In this paper, we consider the OFDM-based bidirectional
transmission where a pair of users exchange information with or without the
assistance of a single DF relay. Each user can communicate with the other via
three transmission modes: direct transmission, one-way relaying, and two-way
relaying. We jointly optimize the transmission policies, including power
allocation, transmission mode selection, and subcarrier assignment for
maximizing the weighted sum rates of the two users with diverse
quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. We formulate the joint optimization
problem as a mixed integer programming problem. By using the dual method, we
efficiently solve the problem in an asymptotically optimal manner. Moreover, we
derive the capacity region of two-way DF relaying in parallel channels.
Simulation results show that the proposed resource-allocation scheme can
substantially improve system performance compared with the conventional
schemes. A number of interesting insights are also provided via comprehensive

resulting from the interplay between the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and
further neighbor exchange couplings, two of the most important mechanisms for
stabilizing incommensurate spin orders. We compute the low-energy spin-wave
spectrum based on a microscopic spin Hamiltonian and find a dispersion relation
characteristic of the helimagnons. By numerically integrating the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with realistic model parameters, an overall
agreement between experiment and the numerical spectrum, lending further
support to the view that a softened optical phonon triggers the magnetic
transition and endows the lattice a chirality.

dominate distinct encounters' bounded nature. An individual's encounter
capability is rooted in his/her daily behavioral regularity, explaining the

and sustainment of altruism in societies. The standard approach to indirect
reciprocity are reputation models. These are games in which players base their
decisions on their opponent's reputation gained in past interactions with other
players (moral assessment). The combination of actions and moral assessment
leads to a large diversity of strategies, thus determining the stability of any
of them against invasions by all the others is a difficult task. We use a
variant of a previously introduced reputation-based model that let us
systematically analyze all these invasions and determine which ones are
successful. Accordingly we are able to identify the third-order strategies
(those which, apart from the action, judge considering both the reputation of
the donor and that of the recipient) that are evolutionarily stable. Our
results reveal that if a strategy resists the invasion of any other one sharing
its same moral assessment, it can resist the invasion of any other strategy.
However, if actions are not always witnessed, cheaters (i.e., individuals with
a probability of defecting regardless of the opponent's reputation) have a
chance to defeat the stable strategies for some choices of the probabilities of
cheating and of being witnessed. Remarkably, by analyzing this issue with
adaptive dynamics we find that whether a honest population resists the invasion
of cheaters is determined by a Hamilton-like rule---with the probability that
the cheat is discovered playing the role of the relatedness parameter.

Based on decision theory, in the past many mathematical models such as crisp
set, probability distribution, fuzzy set, intuitionistic fuzzy set were
developed to deal with complicating aspects of diagnosis. But, many such models
are failed to include important aspects of the expert decisions. Therefore, an
effort has been made to process inconsistencies in data being considered by
Pawlak with the introduction of rough set theory. Though rough set has major
advantages over the other methods, but it generates too many rules that create
many difficulties while taking decisions. Therefore, it is essential to
minimize the decision rules. In this paper, we use two processes such as pre
process and post process to mine suitable rules and to explore the relationship
among the attributes. In pre process we use rough set theory to mine suitable
rules, whereas in post process we use formal concept analysis from these
suitable rules to explore better knowledge and most important factors affecting
the decision making.

molecular gas mass of M(H2) = 6x10^10 M(sun) (for M(H2)/L'(CO)=0.8). While the
bulk of the molecular gas coincides with the central radio galaxy, there are
indications that a substantial fraction of this gas is associated with
satellite galaxies or spread across the inter-galactic medium on scales of tens
of kpc. In addition, we tentatively detect CO(1-0) in the star-forming
proto-cluster galaxy HAE 229, 250 kpc to the west. Our observations are
consistent with the fact that the Spiderweb Galaxy is building up its stellar
mass through a massive burst of widespread star formation. At maximum star
formation efficiency, the molecular gas will be able to sustain the current
star formation rate (SFR ~ 1400 M(sun)/yr, as traced by Seymour et al.) for
about 40 Myr. This is similar to the estimated typical lifetime of a major

with a time separation of ~10 min. The first emission (Ep. 1) goes from 40s
before the 1{\deg} trigger up to 60s after it. The second (Ep. 2) goes from 35s
before the 2{\deg} trigger to 100s after it.[...] Within the Induced
Gravitational Collapse (IGC) model, we assume the progenitor to be a close
binary system composed of a core of an evolved star and a Neutron Star (NS).
The evolved star explodes as a Supernova (SN) and ejects material that is
partially accreted by the NS. We identify this process with Ep. 1. The
accretion process brings the NS over its critical mass, thus gravitationally
collapsing to a BH. This process leads to the GRB emission, Ep. 2.[...] Aims:
We analyze the spectra and time variability of Ep. 1 and 2 and compute the
relevant parameters of the binary progenitor[...] in the IGC paradigm. Methods:
We perform a time-resolved spectral analysis of Ep. 1 with a blackbody (BB)
plus a power-law (PL) spectral model. We analyze Ep. 2 within the Fireshell
model, identifying the Proper-GRB (P-GRB) and simulating the light curve and
spectrum. We establish the redshift to be z=0.75 [...]. Results: We find for
Ep. 1 a BB temperature following a broken PL with time, with the PL slopes at
early and late times \alpha=0 and \beta=-4+/-2, respectively, and a break at
t=41.21s. The total energy of Ep. 1 and 2 are E_{iso}^1=1.42x10^{53}erg and
E_{iso}^2=2.43x10^{52}erg, respectively. We find at transparency a Lorentz
factor \Gamma~173, laboratory radius of 6.04x10^{13}cm, P-GRB observed
temperature kT_{P-GRB}=12.36keV, baryon load B=0.0057 and P-GRB energy
E_{P-GRB}=3.44x10^{50}erg. [...] Conclusions: We interpret GRB110709B as a
member of the IGC sources, together with GRB970828, GRB090618 and GRB101023.
The XRT data during Ep. 2 offers an unprecedented tool for improving the
diagnostic of GRBs emission.

artificial crystal. An implementation including the atomic occupation of a
single excited atomic state can be represented by a two-component Bose-Hubbard
model. Its phase diagram exhibits a quantum phase transition from a superfluid
to a Mott insulator phase. The dynamics of electronic excitations governed by
electrostatic dipole-dipole interactions in the ordered regime can be well
described by wave-like collective excitations called excitons. Here we present
an extensive study of such excitons for a wide range of geometries and
dimensionality. Their lifetimes can vary over many orders of magnitude from
metastable propagation to superradiant decay. Particularly strong effects occur
in one dimensional atomic chains coupled to tapered optical fibers. For an
optical lattice within a cavity the excitons are coupled to cavity photons and
the resulting collective cavity QED model can be efficiently formulated in
terms of polaritons. Their properties are explicitly calculated for different
lattices and they constitute a non-destructive monitoring tool for important
system properties. Even the formation of molecules in optical lattices
manifests itself in modified polariton properties as e.g. an anisotropic
optical spectrum. Partial dissipation of the exciton energy in the lattice
leads to heating, which can be microscopically understood through a mechanism
transferring atoms into higher Bloch bands via a resonant excitation transfer
among neighboring lattice sites. The presence of lattice defects like vacancies
in the Mott insulator induces a characteristic scattering of polaritons, which
can be optically observed to monitor the lattice integrity. Our models can be
applied to simulate and understand corresponding collective phenomena in solid
crystals, where many effects are often masked by noise and disorder.

mass. We consider the latter to be an indication of its mass before the
mass-transfer event. For these stars we define a mass difference ($\delta M$)
between the mass determined from its luminosity and the present mass determined
from fitting the binary orbit. We compare the observed values of the mass
difference to stellar models with mass loss. The range of initial secondary
masses that we find for observed W UMa type binaries is 1.3-2.6 M$_{\odot}$. We
discover that the A- and the W-subtype contact binaries have different ranges
of initial secondary masses. Binary systems with an initial mass higher than
$1.8 \pm 0.1$ M$_{\odot}$ become A-subtype while systems with initial masses
lower than this become W-subtype. Only 6 per cent of systems violate this
behavior. We also obtain the initial masses of the primaries using the
following constraint for the reciprocal of initial mass ratio: $0 < 1/q_i < 1$.
The range of initial masses we find for the primaries is 0.2-1.5 M$_{\odot}$,

By means of
a linear perturbation analysis, we study the dynamical stability of a spherical
self-gravitating isothermal fluid of finite volume and find that the conditions
for the onset of the gravothermal catastrophe, under different external
conditions, coincide with those obtained from thermodynamical arguments. This
suggests that the gravothermal catastrophe may reduce to Jeans instability,
rediscovered in an inhomogeneous framework. We find normal modes and
frequencies for the fluid system and show that instability develops on the
dynamical time scale. We then discuss several related issues. In particular:
(1) For perturbations at constant total energy and constant volume, we
introduce a simple heuristic term in the energy budget to mimic the role of
binaries. (2) We outline the analysis of the two-component case and show how
linear perturbation analysis can be carried out also in this more complex
context in a relatively straightforward way. (3) We compare the behavior of the
fluid model with that of the collisionless sphere. In the collisionless case
the instability seems to disappear, which is at variance with the linear Jeans
stability analysis in the homogeneous case; we argue that a key ingredient to
understand the difference (a spherical stellar system is expected to undergo
the gravothermal catastrophe only in the presence of some collisionality, which
suggests that the instability is dissipative and not dynamical) lies in the
role of the detailed angular momentum in a collisionless system. Finally, we
briefly comment on the meaning of the Boltzmann entropy and its applicability
to the study of the dynamics of self- gravitating inhomogeneous gaseous

sequence stellar systems using the apsidal motion of low-mass detached
eclipsing binaries. The apsidal motion of a binary system with an eccentric
orbit provides information regarding the interior structure constants of the
individual stars. These constants are related to the normalized stellar
interior density distribution and can be extracted from the predictions of
stellar evolution models. We demonstrate that low-mass, pre-main sequence stars
undergoing radiative core contraction display rapidly changing interior
structure constants (greater than 5% per 10 Myr) that, when combined with
observational determinations of the interior structure constants (with 5 -- 10%
precision), allow for a robust age estimate. This age estimate, unlike those
based on surface quantities, is largely insensitive to the surface layer where
effects of magnetic activity are likely to be most pronounced. On the main
sequence, where age sensitivity is minimal, the interior structure constants
provide a valuable test of the physics used in stellar structure models of
low-mass stars. There are currently no known systems where this technique is
applicable. Nevertheless, the emphasis on time domain astronomy with current
missions, such as Kepler, and future missions, such as LSST, has the potential
to discover systems where the proposed method will be observationally feasible.

inverse problem occurs in nonlinear optics in the context of ultrashort laser
pulse characterization. The novelty of the mathematical model consists in a
physically required extension of the deautoconvolution problem beyond the
classical case usually discussed in literature: (i) For measurements of
ultrashort laser pulses with the self-diffraction SPIDER method, a stable
approximate solution of an autocovolution equation with a complex-valued kernel
function is needed. (ii) The considered scenario requires complex functions
both, in the solution and the rhs of the integral equation. Since, however,
noisy data are available not only for amplitude and phase functions of the rhs,
but also for the amplitude of the solution, the stable approximate
reconstruction of the associated smooth phase function represents the main goal
of the paper. An iterative regularization approach is described that is
specifically adapted to the physical situation in pulse characterization, using
a non-standard stopping rule for the iteration process of computing regularized
solutions. Our approach is illustrated by several case studies for synthetic
noisy data and physically realistic complex-valued kernel functions. Based on
an example with focus on amplitude perturbations, we show that the
autoconvolution equation is locally ill-posed everywhere. To date, the
analytical treatment of the impact of noisy data on phase perturbations remains
an open question. However, we show its influence with the help of numerical
experiments. Moreover, we formulate assertions on the non-uniqueness of the
complex-valued autoconvolution problem, at least for the simplified case of a
constant kernel. The presented results and figures associated with case studies
illustrate the ill-posedness phenomena also for the case of non-trivial complex
kernel functions.

condensed-matter and atom physics research. The common feature of these very
different material classes lies in the fact that the competition between
low-energy scales can be tuned by a nonthermal parameter, such as pressure,
magnetic or electric field, and chemical composition for the condensed-matter
systems. In heavy-fermion materials, the strong exchange J between f-electrons
and conduction electrons can lead to quenching of the f-electron-derived
(nearly) localized magnetic moments via the Kondo effect or, if J becomes
weaker, to long-range magnetic order via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida
interaction mediated by the conduction electrons. In addition it has been
suggested that magnetic order can be suppressed by quantum fluctuations which
may be enhanced by geometric frustration. Here we report on the observation of
a quantum phase transition in a partially frustrated antiferromagnetic metallic
system. In antiferromagnetic CePdAl the magnetic Ce ions form a network of
equilateral triangles in the (001) plane, similar to the kagom\'e lattice, with
one third of the Ce moments not participating in long-range order. The N\'eel
temperature T_N = 2.7 K can be driven to zero upon replacing 14.4% of Pd by Ni.
Here the specific heat C exhibits a C/T ~ - log T dependence. Within the
Hertz-Millis-Moriya model of quantum criticality, this behavior can be
attributed to two-dimensional critical antiferromagnetic fluctuations arising
from the decoupling of three-dimensional magnetic order by frustration. The
intermediate planes of frustrated moments are a possible candidate for a
two-dimensional spin-liquid. The simultaneous presence of magnetic order,
geometric frustration, and Kondo effect in this system might thus entail a new
route to quantum criticality.

the Eulerian frame and based on constrained variations of the phase space fluid
velocity and particle distribution function. Using a Legendre transform, we
explicitly derive the field theoretic Hamiltonian structure of the system. This
is carried out with a modified Dirac theory of constraints, which is used to
construct meaningful brackets from those obtained directly from
Euler-Poincar\'{e} theory. Possible applications of these formulations include
continuum geometric integration techniques, large-eddy simulation models and

arbitrage prices of firm values, which are derivatives of exogenous asset
values. In contrast to the Merton model, the assumption of lognormally
distributed assets does not result in lognormally distributed firm values,
which also affects the corresponding probabilities of default. In a simulation
study we see that, depending on the type of cross-ownership, the lognormal
model can lead to both, over- and underestimation of the actual probability of
default of a firm under cross-ownership. In the limit, i.e. if the levels of
cross-ownership tend to their maximum possible value, these findings can be
shown theoretically as well. Furthermore, we consider the default probability
of a firm in general, i.e. without a distributional assumption, and show that
the lognormal model is often able to yield only a limited range of
probabilities of default, while the actual probabilities may take any value

canonical parametrization of a path by length. In this paper we provide such a
parametrization for all continuous paths. This parametrization is based on an
alternative notion of path length, which we call $\mathsf{len}$. Like Euclidean
path length, $\mathsf{len}$ is invariant under isometries of $\mathbb{R}^n$, is
monotone with respect to sub-paths, and for any two points in $\mathbb{R}^n$
the straight line segment between them has minimal $\mathsf{len}$ length.
  Unlike Euclidean path length, the $\mathsf{len}$ length of any path is
defined (i.e., finite) and $\mathsf{len}$ is continuous relative to the uniform
distance between paths. We use this notion to obtain characterizations of those
families of paths which can be reparameterized to be equicontinuous or compact.
Finally, we use this parametrization to obtain a canonical homeomorphism
between certain families of arcs.
